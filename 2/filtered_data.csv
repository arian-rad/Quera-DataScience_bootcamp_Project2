I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs. I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it. (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.

Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine. Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims. I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install. Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem. The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force. Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.

I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises. An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount. If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it). If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount.",I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.

Unlike my previous cover (which I lost along with my Nook on a backpacking trip), this cover holds the Nook by way a pair rugged plastic tabs that perfectly fir the little detentes in the top and bottom edge of the Nook.  (I never knew what those detentes were for before getting this cover).  At first I was a little skeptical about how securely the Nook would be held in place, but it's not a problem - they hold quite securely.

The cover has a nice feel, almost like a hybrid between rubber and suede.

I was also quite surprised when  to find that his cover appears to be a genuine Barnes and Noble product.  It came in a nice box that has lots of Barnes and Noble identification, and a price tag showing a Barnes and Noble list price that is almost 4 times what I paid here at Amazon.

5,,False,2017-11-25,A306NASGVUDFKF,B00000JBHP,{'style:': ' Professional'},Jeffrey E,"I own about 10 or 12 headphones and they are scattered all throughout the house and a few at work. Wireless, wired, noise canceling, over ear and on ear and several earbuds for good measure.  Some are cheap and some are quite expensive, but all hold up to my liking.  So it was easy for me to jump on these headphones from Yamaha offered via Amazon Vine as I am always on the lookout for for new phones to listen to my music.

I must say right off the bat that I really like these headphones a lot. They fulfill all my requirements when listening to music - comfort, quality, signal range and signal response.  All with one minor caveat (I would give these 4.5 stars if I could).

Comfort:  These are lightweight and sit comfortably on the head.  They are easy to adjust to head size and are not overly tight and they are not too loose.  The cups are large enough for my big ears (which many fail here for me!) and the pads are very comfortable against the skin.  The headband sits nicely on the head and does not push my hair around or bind anywhere.  5 stars for comfort!

Quality:  These are lightweight but they appear to be very well made (time will tell how long they hold up).  I can not see any obvious areas for concern.  The hinges are strong and stable and have their own built in backup for added support.  The cord is robust and nicely secured to the earmuff, there is a 60 degree bend at the jack - nice touch.  5 stars for quality!

Signal range / response: These sound great.  The bass is not overly powerful but is clearly present and the highs are crisp without coming across as brassy.  The range is broad and a flat signal sounds great - no equalization needed to get great sound.  This is really nice because I listen to a lot of different music types and styles. 5-stars for sound!

So what is my caveat?  The cord coil.  I like a coiled cord in many circumstances - like plugged into my phone.  I hate when I get a 6' cord and have to deal with a unruly snake that ends up getting tangled all over the place.  However...  When sitting at my desk, the coiled cord tends to pull because my jack is slightly too far away.  I am sure that this will free up a bit over time but right out of the box it is a bit too tightly coiled. Take away half a star for this but I honestly struggle with cords - and the lack thereof!  You either end up with a tangled string that catches on everything, a coil that tethers you too close to the source or a wireless connection that compromises on fidelity, resolution and range.

Overall, these are my new favorites.  I can get past the ""newness"" to say this with honesty.  These are damn nice headphones!.  While typing I have listened to Joe Russo, Waylon Jennings, Steep Canyon Rangers, Robin Trower, Bach, Joe Bonamassa, Eric Clapton, Pink Floyd, Jim Gaffigan and BFG - all sound fantastic; even the cord has loosened up a bit.

Great addition to anyone's music.

They never seem to last more than a year, but I guess it's my own fault I never take advantage of their life-time warranty.

I was big into stereo gear at the time and had nice (large) headphones and lots of gear. The rep showed them to me, said they were the best and I didn't believe him due to their lightweight and small profile. Plus, at the time the price ($50) was pretty 'rich' for such a small pair of headphones considering the market was flooded with $5-$20 lightweight cheap headphones out of asia that you could buy at any Kmart (yes!) or anywhere else. I happened to have my Aiwa TOTL Cassette walkman in the car, went and got it and plugged them in. The difference was transformative! Here you could take a quality walkman that sounded like a 'walkman' and suddenly get near audiophile quality sound out of the same device! Even a cheap walkman could sound great. Even though I was on a shoestring budget I forked over the $50 on the spot and never looked back!

Still have them and they've been a great investment. Koss used to have a lifetime warranty and I sent them in twice for cord replacements which they sent back with new pads and even a spare set. So, after all these years, I still have them and they still sound about as good as any I've heard since. Pads are available off the internet, and sometimes a piece of hair will work through the foam and curl up inside between the mylar driver and the plastic housing. A vibrating hair can sometimes sound like a 'tick' or distorting audio, so if you hear it, remove the foam pad and gently blow in there. Usually it'll dislodge the hair to the point you can grab the end and pull it out. I've had it where there were several hairs inside. Once cleaned out, they sound great again. One area these wouldn't be that great would be packing into a bag, purse or backpack. I suspect they would break pretty quickly.

The Porta Pro as been said to be KOSS' most popular headphone even more so than the KTXPRO1 that I love still to this day.

So I got a pair of these and as I thought...  wow they are great too as well. It has that same very warm, broad, spread sound that the KTXPRO1 has, balanced non tinny sounding highs, deep bass, with a very thick and rich mid range. There's no weakness when it comes to the sound quality from Koss. I feel I might be able to even wear these even longer than the KTXPRO1 which were also very comfortable too as well.

However, with the price KOSS charges and the limited lifetime warranty they include... these headphones are a steal and as much of a steal as the KTXPRO1. The sound quality rivals headphones that costs 5 to 10 times as much. I suggest you get a pair and try them for yourself.

Everything about this feels cheaper than the older model. Edges are sharper, and the headband has visible tooling marks. The aluminum inserts aren't even stamped as cleanly as they used to be (rough edges). The hinges take quite a bit more force to turn, though they might break in over time.

Mine arrived with the left earpiece not fitting into the frame properly; I had to twist it back into place, but it feels ill-fitting. I guess that beats the ""earpiece fell out"" problem others have reported.

One nitpick: the L-shaped plug (with the thicker cable) does not fit through the hole in my iPhone's case. I had to cut the hole MUCH larger. That said, Koss did try a cable with a smaller straight plug, and that cable ended up being a disaster, so I'll stick with what I've got.

They sound as good as they used to, from what I can tell, but it's sad that Koss caved in to all the money-printing and did what many other manufacturers are doing: cutting corners as much as possible while keeping the price high. Better I think to keep the quality high and raise the price. Instead, Koss raised the warranty charge and cut quality, which means you'll pay the high price over time but have a low-quality product the whole time.

The sound on the Koss Portapro's is hard to explain, but it's a type of sound that I can't imagine many people would dislike. I listen to primarily modern hip-hop music and these really shine with that genre. Fantastic mids, highs and surprisingly pleasant bass. It's honestly a surprising sound for the price point and design of these headphones.

Use environment wise, I would suggest these for primarily mobile use, such as walking, riding the bus. skateboarding, etc. I'm not entirely sure I would suggest them for intense workouts, since I could see them falling off and the ear pads soaking up a lot of sweat in a short period of time. You would probably want to stick with in-ear options in such scenarios.

Comfort wise, I was actually surprised at how comfortable the Portapro's are. They have a really simple adjustment method and several tension settings that allow you to find the right fit for you. Despite this, I do think over extended periods of time (2-3 hours) you will begin to have some sort of ear fatigue since these sit on your ears, rather than around your ears. I guess overall, I don't think I would call the Portapro's ""Really comfortable"" but I wouldn't call them uncomfortable either. For me, the comfort sits somewhere in-between the two.

Overall - would I recommend the Portapro's? Yes. At $39.99 or lower, these are an absolute bargain for the type of sound they put out. The only thing I think the Portapro's could improve on are comfort and perhaps a removable/replaceable cable(s) however, it is important to keep in mind that these do come with Koss's lifetime warranty, meaning if anything happens to them, you can send them into Koss for repair.

OK, they're not as good sounding as my other more expensive headphones, but they are also a fraction of their cost and are designed to be used with cheaper portable players.  Compare them to headphones at the same price range and there is no competition. The sound quality is balanced, warm and clear with good bass extension, however, it had a tendency to get a little flabby, muddy  and fatiguing with dense musical passages with portable music players.  They really have a nice wide sound stage that really surprises me on certain musical tracks.

Don't buy them for sound isolation as they don't isolate outside sound well, but as a trade off, they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn.  They are light, cool and I can wear them for hours at a time with no fatigue.

The sound is amazing, the bass is full and punchy, and doesn't overwhelm the raw and controlled mids, or the clear and untouched treble. Like others have said, if you hear any inconsistencies, it's not the headphones' fault.

 But I definitely recommend (if you download your music) that you make sure all of your music is 320 Kbps. Think of it as basically the equivalent of frames per second for music. Obviously not exactly the same, but the point is that it determines the overall quality. 320 Kbps is the best quality for the lowest file size.

Sound:

  Some have had issue with certain sounds though, but not to worry if you're dedicated; that can be fixed. I'm what you would call an audiophile. I can spend hours fixing music (to my own liking obviously) with equalizers- something I very much recommend no matter who you are (unless you're using them for voice calls, in which case- I recommend something cheaper). Some have talked about the piercing clarity causing headaches and lowering overall comfortability over time. Or the bass not being punchy enough, or boomy. These headphones may not come out of the box with a fix for this, but headphones like this are what you would call ""flat"". They give you the natural sound of the recording. They're meant to be tampered with (in terms of sound quality via audio equalizers). I'd recommend a well rated equalizer, or even two- some can go together well. It can easily fix these issues, including by lowering the harshness of the sharper sounds. Or even making your bass more punchy and controlled, or by making it more boomy and warm. Don't be scared to experiment with these. But don't assume you'll even want to either. Most are perfectly fine with the out-of-the-box pristine sound.

Comfortability:

  Some have issues with this, some don't. In most cases it depends on your ear size, and the width of your head. But for those who may have an issue- consider earpads. Many of which go very well with these- and may likely fix all your comfortability issues, this would be my first recommendation. Or if clamping effect is a problem, you can simply stretch them a bit- be a bit careful though. Put them around a book or something. Don't start off stretching them too much. Go slow about it. They will feel more comfortable, they'll feel lighter, still have the same sound effects, and won't irritate your ear, or the weak points surrounding your ear. They'll also still feel tight and secure. The loosening is something that will happen over time anyways. Things like this can just speed up the process and help you out in a much shorter period of time.

  Basically, these headphones are an easy five stars. And all the most common issues can be easily dealt with. I find myself listening to music even when I don't want to, just to hear different songs in ways I thought I'd never hear them. Highly recommended. FYI, I managed to get a brand new, untouched pair by simply looking at the used section for 76$ instead of the normal 120$ price, or the on-sale price (which comes across often) of 90$. Some dealers will give a lower price due to the headphones being bought, even though they never left the box.","The Perfect Headphones for The Price, Hands Down",1460419200.0

I originally purchased this as a mistake not noticing it was a 10/100 or ""fast"" Ethernet with only 100 Mb/s speed.  I decided to keep it since a $10 rebate was being offered by Netgear.  I also thought it could easily be used for my entertainment devices - TV, DVD and Audio receiver since all of those devices have 100 Mb/s Ethernet ports.

But in this particular rebate issue, I feel they are not treating me fairly at all.

That said, I bought this switch (my 3rd), and, even tho it works at the same high quality as other the Netgear products that I own, I now regret my purchase for the following reasons.

First, 5 ports means that you only get 3 additional ports in most cases:  You must connect this switch to your router.  That takes up 1 port on your router and 1 on this switch.  So, net-net, you will only get 3 (n+5-2=n+3) additional ports in most cases.  That said, if you need just a few additional ports at a different location in your residence or business, and/or if you are connecting this to an existing MOCA adapter, this might be a good solution for you.  While I have switches with larger port counts, I will have to exchange switches if I need more ports at this location.  (It's already full, and I have already had to move devices to other switches.)

Second, while I bought one of these under ""Today's Deals"" a number of weeks ago, it appeared today at half the price I paid then.  It would be nice if Amazon had an automatic price guarantee.  This is frustrating to a consumer, and suggests either that a better/cheaper product is coming out soon, or that the market doesn't like the product for some reason, or that, possibly, there is a hidden flaw resulting is dumping and/or discounting.

Consider buying an 8 port switch instead.  Whatever you do, $5 per port is an excellent price.  To do a proper comparison, deduct the two ports you need to give up to connect the switch to your network when you do the price calculation.

Some general networking advice:  It appears that each switch, of necessity, keeps a table of the IP addresses on each port.  I found that adding switches adds network stability because the tables in the switches don't have to be refreshed when you restart your router.  Many times networking problems can be resolved by restarting just your router, causing the router to rebuilt it's IP address table.  However, if restarting your router does not fix the problem, it might be necessary to restart (one or more of) your switch(es).","Good Quality, but usually only 3 effective additional ports.

I also wanted the greater viewing capability of a 16 power lens. The optics worked as expected with no serious flaws. The weight reduction in my suitcase is greatly appreciated. My full-size binoculars are great, but they are just too heavy for airline travel. This Bushnell model loses one star in the rating for each of the following four reasons:

Upon opening the package and removing the binocular, the bottom center cover piece fell out of the packaging. I thought it might just snap back in, but it was a glued application. So, instead of dealing with the hassle of a return, I got out the super glue and installed the plastic cover as intended. My repair seems to be holding just fine. (I have no idea why the Chinese manufacturer was unable to correctly assemble the product.)

Second, the carry case included with the product was way too small for the binoculars. One had to use both hands and fair amount of force to get them in the case, and the case was quite thin with no protective padding whatsoever. Fortunately, I had a small padded camera case that fits them just fine.

Third, the tiny cleaning cloth was not microfiber, but something closer to a piece of felt that left a dozen small particles behind when it was unfolded. It was clearly not worth the cleanup effort.

Finally, I read the warranty and discovered that if one has a valid defect in workmanship or materials, one has to send the company a check for $10 for postage and handling along with the defective product. That is just NUTS and profoundly unfair to the consumer.

They honestly sound like a lot of headphones in the 500-700 department. Some will say they still hold up today as the best headphones in their range. I would not disagree with them. The sound is very realistic. The bass only a little lacking in the sub regions. Otherwise throughout the midrange and treble I find them nearly unmatched in the 200-500 dollar range. The sound of the instruments is really natural and immersive. I have no complaints so far. The design is very comfortable for me, and I have a large head. It has an old school 90s vibe to it, which it should has they debuted in the late 90s. But it is still very high quality. Highly recommended when Amazon has a deal now and then.

I think the sound is great for all genres. Some may want a different type of sound from certain genres and should look at various in-depth reviews to make their decision, like those at inner fidelity and other audio sites. The high-end on these is very good. They are some of the most neutral headphones I have used, and you can play them for hours without problems with most music.

Sennheiser also has some of the best customer service in the world. They really change things around fast and even pay for shipping if a piece fails and you are in warranty. I have nothing but good things to say here. My drivers came matched extremely well, and the entire set was in great shape. They come in a large hard box where you can store them. I use them on a desk, so I also use the foam piece to set them on when they are done being used. I would not set them on a hard table over and over as that could damage the plastic pieces that are painted over time.

If you treat these things well they hold up. I am very pleased with my purchase, and would not hesitate if these were 4 or 5 hundred dollars. Personally, I like them more than the HD650 because these headphones are simply more neutral and sound better with high quality instruments to my  ears.

The limiting factor on image clarity is often atmospheric conditions for my use, viewing birds, whales, and aircraft here on the coast. You still need to hold the binoculars steady, but the image stabilization is a big help and you don't need to use a tripod if you've got at all a steady hand or can brace against something. You'll need to bring along extra AA batteries if you leave the IS on, but I get pretty good battery life by leaving it off until I've got my subject in the viewfinder, then hitting the IS button for a good look at it.

I'm taking off a star for not providing any protection for the large lenses, only the bothersome soft rubber caps for the eyepiece lenses. Come on, a $1300 pair of binocs and you can't even include lens protectors??  I'm going to try 58mm polarizing filters for protection and also to see if they can help with image clarity under adverse atmospheric conditions.

Also, pay attention to how you attach the neck strap. It may be obvious to most people, but I at first made an insecure attachment, by feeding the strap through the retainer but not the gripping clip. Almost dropped them. Doh!

Incidentally, the price on these jumps around quite a bit and careful shopping can save you a couple hundred dollars. Do pay attention to the seller's policy on returns, because that varies greatly.","Powerful and steady, good image quality.",1502755200.0

I purchased a pair in June of 2005, but the image stabilizer failed after about six months, and I sent them back to Canon for repair. When they came back there were significantly mis-collimated, so I returned them again for repair. That all took place in early 2006 and all repairs were made at no charge under warranty. Since then they have worked absolutely flawlessly - over 10 years now, in spite of a lot of use. There have been no issues with the optics, the Image stabilization or the physical appearance. Mind you, I do take very good care of them - I bought a Pelican 1200 case and a pair of 58mm lens caps. I treat them as the delicate optical instrument they are, and have several pairs of non-image stabilized binoculars for ""rough"" occasions. As an avid astronomer, I have to say this is one of the best astronomical purchases I have ever made. I have seen all 110 Messier objects and vast numbers of NGC objects with them - and to do that with a handheld pair of binoculars is outstanding.
One piece of advice - you will get substantially sharper images if you focus with the image stabilizer OFF, and then engage it after you focus- why this is so, I am not sure - obviously one would normally take advantage of the stabilizer to focus, but stars the stars are noticeably less pin-point if you do that. I also purchased the anti-fog eyepiece inserts and while expensive, those work very nicely - at one very heavily dewed, observing session, several people came over to figure out why I was still observing after they had all given up.","After initial issues, long-term reliability has been excellent.",1469145600.0

I am merely a college student who has an interest in nature photography on a budget that doesn't allow for some of the $1,000 lenses.
I purchased this lens from a camera store in the area and figured I would give it a try. The worst that could happen would be that I didn't like the lens and would have to return it in 7 days in order to get a full refund.
I took the lens out the first day and started to play around with it a bit. The first thing that caught me off guard was how loud the auto focus motor was. In a busy camera store, it was barely audible; outside trying to take pictures of wildlife, it is a bit louder than I wanted (comparable to a car transmission).
The range was great, but in order to use the longer zoom ranges, I would recommend using a tri-pod. Even with a fast shutter speed the images were a bit soft for my taste.
The rotating front element didn't bother me in the slightest (I rarely ever use a polarizer), but if you do, you might want to consider a different lens.
I absolutely loved the weight of this lens. While I was in the store I asked to see the Canon 100-400mm f4.5L and the Canon 70-200mm f4L. Even if I had the money for them, they were very big and bulky for my liking. This lens is would not give you a back injury if you were to take it with you on a hike.
All-in-all, I liked the weight, price, and zoom length; but that is where it ended for me. With the lack of any stabilization, it made it very difficult to hand hold at the higher zoom and still get a decent picture. The zoom was loud and was pretty slow for my liking.
I realize, you get what you pay for, and this lens is good for the price, but in this case, I was more willing to shell out a bit more money for the Tamron 70-300mm f4 that came with a 6 year warranty (Tamron also had a $100 rebate going on at the time as well).","Not bad, but not great either",1453593600.0

I liked the previous bag but found the lack of a zippered secure compartment for small items such as SD-cards to be a problem (I lost two brand new SD cards within weeks of purchase when I carried them in the front storage flap.  I decided that I could not afford to be worried about losing smaller items (even the batteries for the SL-1 are small) so I did some research and bought this bag and it has exceeded my expectations for a bag in this price point.  I am able to stow and quickly access the camera with standard lens and hood attached, plus my 75-300 telephoto zoom in its own padded compartment and have an additional compartment for the battery charger, another lens like my nifty-fifty, or even a canon speedlight, although the 580-EX II is a tight fit.  Since I often use the built-in flash I'll rarely carry the external flash anyway.

The main compartment can be zippered securely and there's a very easy to use buckle closure that would suffice for keeping things safe while working from the bag.  If I were traveling I'd keep it zipped but if I'm wanting quick access to the camera or other lenses I'll use only the buckle.

There is a zipper compartment in the top flap perfect for the SD cards and remote control or microfiber cloth.  The front zippered compartment has two pockets for the charger and extra batteries and there is another zippered  compartment in the inside front that will also carry those small, thin, easy-to-lose items safely.

The shoulder strap is well made and padded and there is a hidden waist belt with clip closure stowed inside the back of the bag.  Using the shoulder strap plus the waist strap I'd feel very safe bicycling with this bag, and the small size and weight of the kit means doing so would not be dangerous or tiring.

While these are advertised as premium lashing straps, rated at 250 lbs, I would not consider them premium but just a middle of the road grade to use for tie down straps. I don't know how they are testing them for a 750 lb breaking strength as there is no certificate of compliance that states they preformed a break test on this lot of nylon to make these lashing straps. They would have to do that with each new lot of straps made and give you that certification. These do not appear to be heavy duty but they will work for common every day uses but I would not trust them to hold a load in the back of your truck. Go with something more heavy duty. I personally wouldn't go any heavier than around 150 lbs with these, though they would probably hold more.

Don't use these like the other reviewer with the cinder block pictures either.

I got one-day delivery so I could more easily compare the new and old.  My new Pro 4AAs also changed sound *very rapidly* as they were played a bit. Straight out of the box, they were buzzy and harsh.  I am glad to say, after a few minutes to an hour, they sound very much like the older model  more-or-less exactly what it was in 1974. This is a 90% good thing with the traditional good and bad points of the Pro4AA - very flat response out the high end, slight cavity resonance coloration, and slightly rolled-off very low bass, where it just can't quite make it. And of course, the amazing weight and pressure -they made people a lot tougher in the good old days; pros would wear these things for 8 hours straight, and they are built to take heavy-duty pro use.

Compared to other more modern headphones, and my reference Grados, they are much more balanced than many current bass-boosted headphones, like the Sony MDR-70 and kin (mildly overdone), and even more so, the over-the-top overboosted Beyerdynamic DT1350. I swear, after a few sessions with the Beyerdynamic, they could be more crazy overkill bass than the execrable Beats, although much, much tighter. The Koss has, of course, much more isolation than the open-back types of any kind, but interestingly, let through more outside noise than the Supra-aural Beyerdynamics.

  Portability - forget it. They are heavy, don't fold or stow neatly, and take every bit of voltage the typical iPod pr iPhone can throw. They aren't hard to drive in terms of current at 250 ohms (compared to something like the 32-ohm Grado) but they aren't very efficient, so for me, just short of wide open is a good listening level - again, just like the originals. Plan on an external amplifier if you use a portable music player. Hard to fault the people at Koss for that one - back in 1970, the entire computing power of the human race was about what you get in an iPod Nano, and people listened to stereo on component systems that were still about 50% tube driven.

  For what you get, the price is definitely right. As I recall, I got my originals at a pretty good sale price of around $35 in 1974-75. After extremely extensive use for about 40 years, they were repaired for free and $9 shipping under the lifetime warranty. Now, they are $75 and have a slightly less lavish limited lifetime warranty. They are more neutral than most other $75 headphones and built like a main battle tank for decades of use.

I also own a few 1960s amplifiers (tube and solid-state) and I wanted to pair them with some headphones that matched the look and style.

These are great headphones.  They are heavy and the plastic is very tough.  I don't think you'll have to worry about breaking them any time soon.

These headphones also sound great!  The cups really do help to cancel out any outside sounds.  It takes a bit to get used to as these really do seal off a lot so if you wear these for extended periods of time your ears will get a bit sweaty.  These headphones also require a break-in period.  I had some problems on the first day with them sounding a bit off.  Very narrow imaging and the bass was actually really boomy to the point that I could feel it vibrating in my jaw and was giving me a headache.  After defeating it a bit with an EQ for a few hours the headphones finally equalled out and now they sound excellent.  These headphones do have a bit of a sweet spot.  If you're a short person like me (5'5"") you might have some wiggle room with the cups.  Get them right or the bass will be a bit more overpowering on one channel compared to the other.

The headphones are a bit revealing too.  If you are using these with a turntable and the azimuth is slightly off these headphones will make it obvious.  If you have an old amp with rumble switches and/or low-pass filter switches and one side of the switch is a bit dirty the bass respone will be very obvious to this.  So be ready for that as well.

These headphones aren't for walking around the house in or jogging.  These demand you sit down and enjoy it.  So don't expect to buy these and walk around the street in or work with.

I had a serious problem with 5 Voltage Adapters (wall worts) that I had to connect to my new Tripp Lite UPS. The power output plugs on the UPS were mostly stacked as close as possible together, which made it impossible to plug them in directly. My first attempt at a solution was to use short power cables, and a couple of Y power cables to help me plug in all of the adapters plus a couple of direct AC plugs. It worked, but resulted in a mess, with all of the adapters in an unsightly pile on the floor, as shown in the first picture, and no way that I could see to clean it up.

Scanning through Amazon for a solution to my problem at 3 in the morning, I came across the Tripp Lite 8 Outlet Bench & Cabinet Power Strip. While I would have preferred that they had oriented the receptacles with the plugs perpendicular to the length of the strip, I was confident it would accommodate my adapters, which it does, with one outlet to spare.

I really appreciate that they included of a sturdy shield for the power switch, to prevent inadvertent power losses. The unit is built to industrial standards, encased in solid aluminum all around, and the receptacles fit tightly to the adapter plugs, so there is no risk of fallout. The strip does not include a surge protection device, so it it ideal for attaching to a UPS system.

With the addition of the power strip, I was able to clean up the installation, and also get everything off of the floor. The second pic shows the end result.  The only thing I wasn't pleased with was the 15 ft AC power cord. I could have ordered the one with a 6 ft cord, but the listing showed it costing at least $10 more than the 15 foot  model - I didn't understand the logic of that pricing at all.  I was going to just leave the power cord in place, but decided to bite the bullet and cut it short. I added a good quality Hubbell power plug.

The cord is only 14awg wire, would have preferred 12awg, but it's not necessary, it's only a 15 amp plug on the end and the UL allows up to 18 amps up to 50ft at 14awg, so this is more than sufficient for this 15 foot cord.

The plugs are very tight, requiring at least 5lb of force to pull out, so you won't be worrying about plugs coming out under vibration or light tugs.

It comes with 3 mounting clips which lift the strip about 5mm (a little under 1/4"") off the mounting surface.  The clips are secure and the plugs can be inserted and removed without the strip coming out of the clips. The hardware includes 3 washers, 3 one inch wood/coarse thread screws, and 3 half inch machine screws (looks like 8-32, but don't hold me to that!). These clips can be placed anywhere along the length. The clips can also clip to the top of the strip at either end or between the outlets, and lift the strip enough away from the surface that the outlets don't prevent the clip from attaching.  You might give up some outlets if you mount it this way, but for tricky mounting situations this might be very useful. They do not clip to the sides, though.

The power cord comes out the top next to the power switch, and the circuit breaker is on the end.  I'd prefer the breaker and power cord were switched, with the power cord coming out the end, but that's not a big deal.

I love these strips, and at just under $3 an outlet they don't compare unfavorably to the cost of the three or more generic power strips this single unit would replace. With this order I now have 6 of these strips serving in various capacities, for over 10 years.  I don't plug things into them frequently, mostly things stay plugged in once attached, so I can't speak to the cycles of each individual plug.

Oh, and the power switch is shrouded, which is very helpful to prevent unintended power cuts.  The little lid will eventually break off if you open and close it frequently, but even missing the shroud is very effective at preventing anything but intentional switching of the power.

Perhaps the only other thing that might annoy some is that the plugs are rotated along the power strip so that power bricks and wall adaptors may interfere with adjacent outlets.  For the most part that's not an issue as the plugs are spaced about 1 3/4"" apart (~2 3/4"" centers) and I suspect the internal electrical construction of the strip demands this arrangement, but If I had a choice I'd probably prefer the plugs were rotated 90 degrees.

Purchased from a major US hardware store for a little less than listed here with free shipping.  Oddly enough it is listed as cheaper than the shorter 4' one, so shop around. Given that some reviews here suggest mounting hardware isn't included, it may be worth shopping at a major retailer to ensure you don't get a knock-off or a unit missing parts.","Great product, no real downsides.",1493769600.0

Expect to need the use of both hands for steady or extended viewing.  This weight tells in the build - they have a reassuring, solid feel and the optics are bright and clear.  Image is good, though not as sharp as I'd hoped based on the hype some reviewers gave these and parallel vertical lines are noticeably convex in appearance on the pair I purchased.  I think that the focus paddle could benefit from a bit of added width - my fingers are relatively short and I need to release one hand from the barrels to fully articulate it near the end of its range of motion.

The eye cups are light-weight rubber-like material and fold down easily, but I wouldn't expect them to last very long if used frequently. Whatever problem noted in other reviews with lens caps being loose seems to have been addressed - the caps accompanying mine are snug and secure.  Still, there are four individual caps to deal with once they're off the lenses...

The nylon canvas case provided appears to be more of a gesture of goodwill than anything else as it offers little in the way of protection other than from dust and perhaps moisture.  The straps (both for the case and the binoculars) are adequate to their intended function.

I received these 4 days ago and spent several hours listening to them and comparing them to my ""cheapies"", a pair of 10 year old Grado SR80s.  In the end, I determined that they were either defective or the amp supplied with them is not tuned to compensate for limitations in the drivers.

As I mentioned, I'm comparing a brand new pair of these with my old Grado SR80's... very different headphones in design, sound and cost.  I listened for about 4 hours the first night I had them and for about another 4 hours since. I'm using a Schiit Modi Uber DAC with my iTunes library... some of which is digitized from vinyl (48KHz/24bit if that matters).  I have owned electrostatic loudspeakers for many years (Acoustat III's) so I'm familiar with their characteristics and sound.

The Grados have been my main phones for a very long time and for good reason. At $99, they have been remarkably detailed and tonally pretty transparent. There is a bit of an emphasis in the highest frequencies but they are not harsh or bright. The low end is very solid and tight. Vocals sound a bit thin and recessed but not excessively so. When listening to Dave Grusin's ""Discovered Again"" direct-to-disc album, the triangles and cymbals sound crisp and clear.

Switching the 950's, the first thing I notice is how prominent the mid range is. It's very full and rich but if I set the volume up to a comfortable level, the lows and highs practically vanish. It's as if the frequency response curve is dome shaped. I'm guessing this is either a characteristic of the stock amp or a defect in the amp. That's pretty unfortunate, as the headphones are quite detailed, particularly in the upper mids and lower highs. When listening to Dave Grusin's album, the triangles and cymbals are still there but are muffled and lack the presence of the Grados. I've listened to this album on many speakers too and the Grados sound more like those speakers. Switching to Elton John's 'Funeral for a Friend' was also disappointing. Early in the song, when the raspy ARP synthesizer kicks in, it sounds like someone put a pillow over it! I've never heard that on any other pair of headphones or loudspeakers.

I did find a software tweak that 'fixes' the roll off at the extremes but I'm not thrilled with it.  iTunes does have a built-in EQ.  If I set the 16KHz slider to 6db and the 8KHz slider to 3db, that fixes the high end roll off. Likewise, if I set the 32 Hz to 6db and 64 Hz to 3db, that fixes the low end roll off.  These changes actually make the phones sound damn good but I'm having trouble squaring this with my idea that everything should sound good with the tone controls FLAT.

Yesterday, I called Koss directly and asked to speak someone in tech support to see if my experience was ""normal"" or perhaps I had a defective amp or something. The customer service lady told me I could not speak to anyone... that I had to submit a form on their website. While still on the phone, I navigated to the help page and found a live chat feature which had an option of live chat for customer service or tech support. I asked if I could use that and she said ""both chat options just go to customer service. There is no live tech support chat"".  So, I submitted the form. I received no email confirmation of the submission and now 24 hours later, still nothing in my inbox.  So... in the absence of any real help from Koss and with the nagging feeling that these are somehow 'broken', I elected to send them back for a refund.

UPDATE - No reply from Koss 48 hours after submission. The ""lifetime"" warranty is touted in a number of online reviews for these but that's only a good selling point if you get decent service. If I do finally hear back, I'll post the results here. If I don't, I'll drop the review down to 1 star.

FINAL UPDATE - I never did receive any kind of reply from Koss tech support concerning my questions.  Nothing. A lifetime warranty is a great thing on principal but useless with this level of service.  Downgraded this review to 1-star because of this.

POST MORTEM - It's worth mentioning that even though I never received a support reply from Koss, I can confirm that they did receive my support questions... because now I'm getting marketing emails from them!  LOL

***UPDATE: Sorry.. I know.. the review that never ends! I ordered another similarly priced electrostatic headphone set and that arrived today (Stax SRS-3100 system).  I'm listening to those as I write this. REALLY nice... very smooth like the Koss cans but without the roll off at the extremes. Cymbals, triangles, hi-hats are crisp and clean, just the way I expect them. Bass is tight and full with just the right amount of impact.  Anyway.. this is not a review for the Stax... just wanted to let you know there's a better electrostatic phone for about the same money.

For all of us who have been using these since the Win98 days when the green PS/2 adapter was still needed instead of USB, and who DIDN'T stock up on these when they were still $35-$40, the best bet these days is to go with a used mouse as the default search-result price is always the highest.  If you click the ""used/new"" link you will see that the used ones run far less than the default price.  For this wonderful product and happy hands, $200-ish is easier to swallow than $500-$700.  Other options used to be the Logitech Optical Trackman as it was somewhat-similar in size and also wireless, but is now discontinued and expensive.  From there it was a random selection of products - I went with the M570 wireless thumball mouse, but prefered the precision of the ""finger"" ball offered by the MS Trackball Explorer.

2017 Update: --- Begin Elecom Section ---

Thanks to the comment below to remind me to get off my lazy rear and update this review!!  :)

In July 2017 Elecom released Two New Versions of their Trackball Mice
1) Wireless ""Huge"" mouse aka M-HT1DRBK aka Amazon# B0735584RM
2) Wired ""Huge"" mouse aka M-HT1URBK ala Amazon# B07353DBP9
These are pretty close in size/style to the MS Trackball Explorer and run around $90-ish new.
Not a 100% match to the MSTE, but cheaper than other possible choices.
** Also to use their proprietary extra buttons, get at least V5.1x of Elecom's software.
...Been using the ""Huge"" model Elecom for 6 weeks now - it's a pretty good substitute.

SKIP THIS BIT ON THE OLDER ELECOM M-DT2DRBK as the (above) version is LARGER with a better ball, etc.
However there does appear to be at least one ""finger"" ball available that has the same basic shape as the MS Trackball explorer, and comes in both wired and wireless versions.  The ""wireless"" version is the Elecom M-DT2DRBK and ""wired"" version is the M-DT2URBK.  Both are available on Amazon (March 2017).
NOTE TO POTENTIAL BUYERS OF ELECOM MICE: First is that it is Much Much Smaller than the MS Trackball.  For reference, the Elecom's ball is the exact size of the smaller Logitech M570.  It doesn't have the same extended palm area of the MS mouse for resting your hand, but is at least the same basic shape and is a ""finger"" ball.  Second is that similar to the Logitech Trackman, the ""right"" mouse button has been moved from it's Correct place above the ""left"" mouse button to over on the other side of the ball.  The button issue is an easy fix.  Either download the vendor's software from their website, or instead go with a third party option like ""X-Mouse Button Control"" which is extremely easy to use and allows multiple profiles and button remappings.  Have been using X-Mouse for years to map the ""right"" button of the Logitech Trackman over to the Correct position above the ""left"" mouse button.  Also allows me to quickly switch profiles between the mappings of the MS Mouse for precision and gaming to the Logitech mouse for everyday use.

..back to original review..
What killed both my original 1990s MS mice was loose wiring.  I kept ""pulling on the mouse's tail"" whenever it fell off my knee or armrest and would grab at the cord.  After paying a few hundred for a used replacement, added veclro to stick it firmly to a mousepad and tied the cord with a ""mouse bungee"" to keep secure the wiring.  Used Mouse #1 has been going for 10 years, and although the scroll wheel is a bit weird at times, no other issues.

Other Trivia:  These days wireless is a great convenience, but can't live without my MS Trackball Explorer, so I have two ""USB Extension cables"" to give me 25+ feet of extra cable to get the mouse wherever it needs to be.  Am keeping an eye on the Nulaxy wireless bluetooth USB although I hear the first revision could use a little work with the battery door and it runs out of power fast unless you hook it up to one of those cellphone external usb power packs or an AC adapter.  Maybe someday there will be a viable alernative for USB wireless via bluetooth or infrared and then will be able to make the MS Trackball Explorer wireless.  (2017 edit: I think the Nulaxy is gone now)

The plastics used in this product bring into question how long this product will last - but so far everything is functioning without any issues.

Installation is straightforward and not labor intensive.  The instructions included are (barely) sufficient to get everything assembled.  Let me put it this way - if you are mechanically inclined (myself included), there's no problem figuring it out.  For those individuals not mechanically inclined - you will find the instructions lack detail and specificity.

With respect to placement: I recommend you use a quality stud and wire finder, because the wall mounting base will not provide sufficient surface area to use drywall taps - the mount really needs to be screwed into a stud for security and stability.  The wall mount is one of the weak points in this design, and really should be re-designed with a larger base for stability - especially when you use this to store and support the weight of a longer and heavier extension cord.  My garage has outlets at chest height, and I mounted the winder above the outlet, on the same stud that supports the outlet housing.  This requires you to measure the overall height of the winder and storage basket for placement and to prevent covering your outlet with the storage basket.  The picture is not a good example of placement, unless you have a random stud in the wall which is close and next to your outlet.

With respect to functionality: so far it has worked exactly as advertised and it coils up the cord exactly as represented in the picture and in the product description.  It works flawlessly with a new cord, but it takes a little coaxing if you have an old cord that's a little dirty.  Mine currently stores 100' of heavy gauge extension cord.

An important suggestion is to uncoil your cord and either have someone hold the other end (easiest), or secure it to an immovable object and then completely untwist it before installing it in this winder.  If you've been winding the cord using the over-the-elbow method, the cord will develop a twist to it, which makes it harder for this winder to neatly wind the cord.

Again, the plastic materials do not appear to be high quality - but I'll post updates as the product is used more, and if the device fails.
Until then - it makes winding and storing a long heavy extension cord much easier and much more convenient than by doing it by hand.",Works as advertised - the biggest question is how long will it last?,1468972800.0

I bought it hoping to use it to help discover what focal length I would use more often before I lay out the money for a prime lens. I tend to use longer focal lengths because I do more intimate/unobtrusive portraits. This lens is performing beautifully throughout its range. The images are sharp. Perfectly sharp. They are bright and gorgeous. And the lens is a featherweight. I am using it on a Nikon D7100, which has the in-the-body focusing mechanism that this lens needs to auto focus. Focus is fast and accurate. That is the gotcha if you are using the camera models that require the AF-S or SWM lenses (D40, D3xxx, D5xxx model lines are the ones that come immediately to mind), those will NOT autofocus with this lens. It will mount and function as a 42-120mm lens on these crop sensor cameras, but only as a manual focus lens.

5,39.0,True,2016-12-18,A354GMGATG4XMU,B00005LENO,,Michael Jin,"I purchased this lens after trying out a 50mm f1.8G and being disappointed with it. I know... Different type of lens and different price point. But the reason I came to this lens rather than the 50mm 1.4G is a conclusion that I came to somewhere in-between those two purchases:

Great lenses don't stop being great because the next thing comes out. It just means that the newer thing may possibly be better.

Now I'm sure plenty can be argued about whether this is a ""great lens"" or not, but the simple point is that this lens, like the 35mm f2D, 85mm f1.4D, and plenty of other older lenses, has served countless photographers and produced countless amazing photos since its inception. The appearance of more capable lenses today doesn't mean that the 50mm 1.4D is suddenly incapable of creating great photos. And let's be honest... how many of us are actually taking photos that can even hold a candle to so many of those photos taken in decades past on all of that ""inferior"" equipment?

I have a Nikon D810 (recently upgraded to full frame from my old D300), so as I build my FX lens collection, I've been facing some odd decisions. Given the fact that I can use these older lenses, I am not forced to default to the newer ""G-Series"" lenses where some others might unfortunately already have that decision made for them by virtue of the fact that their camera bodies cannot autofocus with older lenses.

And while the newer lenses are largely superior in IQ as well as aperture in some cases, the ultimate question I have to ask myself is whether or not those advances are truly meaningful to me at my level. I can definitely tell you that I'm not a pixel-peeper (although even at 1:1, the 50mm 1.4D seems to perform just fine) and I believe that, in fact, technical aspects like that are probably the last thing to worry about behind lighting, composition, etc. And if I'm not really getting meaningful value (as a function of the limits of my own ability as a photographer) out of the newer lens, why spend the extra money to get it? By the time I get to a point where it might actually matter somehow, it's entirely possible that something even newer and better will be out as the endless march of technology continues.

If you're still with me after my ramblings, let me simply say that I've found this to be an absolutely wonderful lens that has more than served my needs. While it's true that my camera may push the limits of this lens on a sheer technical level, my abilities as a photographer have not even begun to outgrow it. It may be different for some of you, but I'm more concerned about nailing a good composition and capturing the feel of scenes than I am about staring at photo comparisons to see which lens renders bokeh slightly better than another or which lens is sharper at the pixel levelthings that I can assure you that nobody on the other side of the camera will ever care about or even notice.

If you're one of the elite photographers for whom this lens will honestly be a limitation, you already know you don't want this. If you're an owner of a body for which this lens will not autofocus because of technical limitations, you should look elsewhere. But if you fall into the same category as me where you have a camera body that can use this lens, but you're still on the journey of learning the art of photography, I encourage you to save a little bit of cash and explore the possibilities of this lens. It will ultimately reward the trust you put in it when you do start taking some of those great photos, and you'll be reminded by the fact that you're doing it on equipment that many people will turn their nose up at as being somehow ""obsolete"" that the essence of your photography doesn't lie within the gear in your camera bag.

Let's get this straight right away - the sound quality on these isn't anything amazing, they're decent and certainly acceptable considering the price, but from a sound standpoint they aren't going to replace anything from Audio-Technica.

So then why am I giving these cans 4 stars?
Well, then answer is right there in my first sentence.
I've been using these headphones since 1999 - they're a workhorse.
They're large, the envelop your entire ear, do a decent job isolating noise, they're very light and very comfortable, and they give you acceptable sound for what you're paying; I personally find the overall sound profile from these to be lacking in depth, with the mids being a bit flat, and the bass a tad muddy, but you can bring them to life with some fine-tuning of a standard 10-band equalizer.

In addition, these headphones are covered under the KOSS lifetime warranty; if they ever break or experience a failure, all you have to do is ship 'em to KOSS along with $9.00 for return shipping, and they'll send you a brand-new replacement pair.
Brand new - not refurbished.
Over the 19 years I've been using these headphones, I've only had to take advantage of the warranty once, so that tells you what you need to know about their build quality.

5,,True,2017-11-09,A3CZ917ZM3KOJ5,B00005T39Y,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},Harrison Whitebread,"Overview:
The CPA-9C shows quality engineering and workmanship, despite its manufacturing takes place in China. I cannot verify the longevity of the device [for now], but it does seem rather sturdy compared to other models in the same price range ($12-16). As for sound quality, this particular cassette is very sensitive to the actual amplification power of your audio device. Lower quality DAC's will perform very poorly with this cassette, however, even with a poor audio device, the sound quality transmitted through the cassette is consistent with the actual quality that the device itself is capable of producing. There is virtually no hissing or cassette noise while in operation. The only flaw this device suffers is the poor transmission of lower end frequencies - they are nearly omitted from playback on any audio device.

Control for Confounds (overkill for most people):
I bought the CPA-9C for use with a 1997 Lincoln Towncar (fleet edition), a 2009 Grand Marquis Ultimate Edition, and a 2010 Crown Victoria, all with the cassette player option in the radio. I used three audio devices with the CPA-9C, ranking with the best playback first: a 256 GB custom 5.5th generation iPod Video (60GB model), an iPhone SE, and a 16GB 5th generation iPod Nano. All devices had no EQ enabled. I used three music files in AIFF format (actually fully lossless & 100% CD quality): Lindsey Webster's Back to Your Heart, Metallica's Unforgiven II, and Justin Timberlake's Strawberry Bubblegum.

As with many 3.5mm female ports, they gather debris over a period of time, so I cleaned each device of any lint or debris (as this effects sound quality in any listening medium). I took this step because in my experience with various Phillips and Belkin cassette adapters that utilize a 3.5mm jack, there is always an evident hissing noise, sometimes from a poor quality connection at the audio device itself. I felt that many reviews didn't specify that they controlled for this, so I thought I would mention it in my review.

 I utilized two separate listening systems to verify that the 3.5 mm ports of each device were consistent - a VSX90 AVR in 5.1 and a UE Boom 2. It was overwhelmingly apparent which devices had a better DAC when using the VSX90, even though the same file was played on all three devices.

The Actual Review:
In each car, the CPA-9C performed exceptionally well, beyond any other cassettes, namely Belkin, Phillips, & Monster. Each car was set to 20% volume on the radio. In all cars, the CPA-9C performed the same each time, each in different temperatures (20F, 45F, 75F). Initially, it took me some time to figure the optimal volume setting for each device - as each has a slightly different output current, and hence, the volume output to the cassette was also different. I found with a higher quality DAC (the best being the custom iPod 5.5th), the sensitivity for volume was also greater. The iPod nano had poor quality and low volume, even when the device was set to full volume, whereas the iPod Video was perfectly content at roughly 50-65% of full volume (in fact, beyond 65%, audio clipping began to occur because the signal was too much for the cassette). The iPhone SE found its highest quality of sound and volume at around 80%.

Each file played well, but there was a noticeable deficit in the lower frequencies. I can only verify this with the 09 & 10 cars, because they also have a CD player (which is how I was able to compare the actual CD track to the same track on each audio device using the CPA-9C). I feel as if this may not be the fault of the CPA-9C though, because the medium of using a tape is lossy - mechanisms in the cassette and cassette player transmit the sound, as opposed to a laser for a CD. There is no hissing as there is with the Phillips and the Belkin, and the quality of the 3.5 mm end is far better than that of the Monster. I believe if you are wanting the best audio quality and all you have is a cassette player in your car, the CPA-9C is the one to buy.

Final Remarks:
From my experience with these cassette adapters (the CPA-9C among others), I learned that the DAC from the source audio device plays a LARGE role in the actual quality that can be transmitted through the cassette to the stereo system in your car. I had an intuition that it would make a difference, but I hadn't realized how much of a difference. If you decide to purchase the CPA-9C, the biggest variable that will influence the sound quality is the source device- not the car, not the cassette player, not the temperature, and not even the file quality used for playback (of course you will hear differences between mp3 and AIFF/WAV).
My best advice to consumers on cassette adapters is this: The CPA-9C is the BEST cassette adapter on the market.
If sound quality is your goal and money is tight, look for a used 5th gen or 5.5th gen iPod video on Amazon. $60-70 is well worth the investment when a quality new radio from Sony or Pioneer costs $500-750. You can load your music up (provided you actually own your own music and not a streaming service) and just go - no strings attached. They are incredibly reliable and are making a surprising comeback in the market. All iPods' value is going up, despite introductions of the new iPhone X and other 'super' devices. Many sellers on Amazon can get you in around $60 if you look around.
If convenience is your goal and you only want to use your smartphone, check your volume levels to ensure you aren't clipping audio. I'd also recommend setting your EQ to 'off' on the source device so you can tune your car's EQ instead. You'll sparing the cassette player of extra work and the sound quality will be much cleaner and crisper.

Lastly, do not believe that a cassette adapter will surpass a CD player. If you want the best quality you can get, it all starts with your source audio device - the quality of the DAC and power of its amplifier. Any cassette player is limited by the mechanisms that dictate its operation - but the Sony CPA-9C will get as close to lossless transmission from your device as possible.",CPA-9C: The Sleeper...Best Cassette Adapter on the Market,1510185600.0

Nikon makes (has made) a bunch of lenses in this F/L range and this one has a lot of good reviews on camera sites. My short-term experience makes me agree with them. I liked this lens since it has a pretty good max aperture (f/4.5--not super fast but not bad) and the front doesn't rotate (maybe none of them do--don't know). I've been using it for a few weeks & liking it. For a long-ish, fat-ish lens it actually handles and balances pretty well on my camera. Another reason for me to pick this lens is that it uses the same 67mm filters as the 18~140. It seemed to me that larger front end opening should mean more light, even though the max f/stop doesn't reflect that. Still--fewer filters to buy.

It might be me, still learning to use the new camera and lenses, but it seems like it could/should be a little sharper, especially on the long end of zoom with distant subjects. But focus speed is very good, and vibration compensation seems to work (I took a dusk tree-line shot at 1/15 sec that shouldn't have turned out as well as it did 8-) so, good deal). For a telephoto lens, it works surprisingly well for close-focus.

There is a newer version of this F/L, and another Pro version ($$$); are they sharper, no idea. Are they worth 2-5x the money? Not to me, at this time. If I change my mind in the future, I might update this review.

I picked this up Refurbished from the Nikon website, generic box and bubble-wrap, not a pretty printed carton, but the lens was clean, included the hood & caps, and I can't see any evidence that it was ever used--and it included a 90 day warranty.

Well this is a bummer, this second set i ordered to replace the first set that was defective seems to be showing signs of failure already after putting it through hours of testing and use over the course of a few weeks. The Bass knob has developed a lot of play in it, almost wobbly feeling. The left speaker has developed a hiss that changes in frequency from low to high and will drive you nuts when trying to sleep. I checked my power in the house for grounding issues and what not, everything is wired correctly. The other set i returned before this never made any hissing noise but it did have the issue where the speaker channels were wired wrong and reversed.

I tried the speaker set at a family members house and my neighbors house and it was still noisy and hissing. Also the subwoofer gets so hot that it will borderline burn your fingers. No Joke! If you have small children, i suggest you not let them near the back of the subwoofer unit where the amplifier is housed. To top things off, where it gets so hot it puts off a burnt electrical odor that smells terrible in the small room it was placed in.

This product really seems to be plagued by very poor QC and it uses Very Very cheap components inside. I looked at the electronics enclosed and it's just the cheapest of the cheap straight out of China. Since it has Klipsch branding on it, you get the privilege of paying a extra $100 on what should be a $50 set of speakers.

Sending these back and going with something else sadly. I will not buy anything made by Klipsch again due to the poor quality and for having the nerve to slap $150 price tag on something that clearly should be no more than $50. Adjusting my final review to 1 star and will not be ordering a third set. I gave them two shots and they failed me both times. The old third time is a charm saying doesn't work with me.

I hate to say it and you're free to do as you please with your money but heed my advice and spend your hard earned money on something that has good or at least decent quality because if you're buying these then you're flushing your money down the drain.

####--------[Original Review]---------####

Defective product from seller Audio Plaza, this was a 5 star but i have since updated my review as i just now noticed after reading other reviews and through my own testing that the left and right sound channels are swapped and not wired correctly and i traced it to to the volume control box thats mounted to the right speaker where you control the volume and bass levels. Inside the volume control box are two wires that go to the 3.5mm male jack that you plug into your computer or any device with a 3.5mm female input, these two wires are crossed and can only be fixed by resoldering the wires to their correct solder points on the board in the volume control box.

I can ghetto fix the speaker issue by just switching the speakers wires to the opposite channels on the subwoofer but the headphones connection on the controller box does the same thing and can not be ghetto fixed without voiding the warranty due to soldering being involved to properly fix it. If i was past warranty i would have fixed it myself as i would have no choice by then. Since it's still within the return window, i will send them back and try another pair. I will update this to show how the new set works and if the issue has been resolved.

I think some of these sellers on here are getting these defective sets on the cheap and selling them full price on Amazon or could just be a bad batch considering they are manufactured in China where QC is basically nonexistent. Check your speakers though as this is something very easy to overlook like i did initially. I mean who the heck would think you would get a defect like this from a brand like Klipsch?

Beware future buyers and check for this issue by adjusting your sound balance from left to right in Windows or your OS of choice. In my case by adjusting the balance, it revealed that right was left and left was right and it was the same with headphones plugged into the speakers headphone jack. The manufacture date sticker on the box was dated March 2017. Could just be a bad batch but makes you wonder when dealing with third party sellers.

The speakers sounded great and functioned well besides the issue i listed above and is why i didn't notice the issue until messing with some EQ settings and adjusting the balance. Afterwards i did some digging and found other reviews with the same issue on here. bummer. i will be sending them back sadly as they sound great otherwise.

Because it works for me . . . so far.

One of the common complaints in the previous model is that after a while, the stand no longer sticks to the back of the tablet.

Some may complain that it adds too much weight to your svelte/sexy tablet.
Lynktec clearly states that their purpose was to create a HEAVY DUTY and STURDY stand to compete with all the flimsy, unreliable stands out there.
So you have to accept their design choice. If you dislike the weight, then take your chances on cheaper, flimsy alternatives.

Lastly, Amazon's return policy and Lynktec's one-year warranty should help you take the chance if you're on the fence.

I have a 14"" HP Elitebook 840 G3. Decided to go with the known brand name over the Akamai privacy filter, also sold on Amazon for a couple dollars less. I went with the 15.6"" black filter because I wanted the filter to extend past the actual display area onto the black bezel area. I did have to trim it about 17mm, but it is now a perfect fit. Fortunately, we have a nice paper cutter/guillotine, so it was very easy to do.

What's in the package (see picture)
It has the filter, 6 adhesive strips, slide mount tabs, and instructions. The instructions say to clean your display with the enclosed lint-free cloth, but there was no cloth included in my package (the packaging does not mention a cloth, to be fair). The package says the dimensions are 194mm x 345mm. I measured 192mm x 352mm. Slightly off, but not significantly so.

Note that my filter has a curved notch offset of center on one of the long sides of the filter, whereas the product image shows a sharper notch in the very center of the long side. Not that it makes a difference in functionality, necessarily, but something to note.

What I like:
The filter does what it says - it filters the picture for those trying to look at the screen from an angle to the side. I positioned myself at about where I would expect a fellow passenger on a plane to be sitting next to me and I could see hardly anything. Only if I intentionally moved closer to get a better angle could I see, and that would be quite conspicuous.

I used the adhesive strips so it would stick to my flat display. I did not use the slide mount tabs. It is a VERY clean look and almost looks as if there is no privacy filter even attached. Big positive. Those slide mount tabs are so unsightly and this looks really nice.

Installation was very straightforward. As I mentioned, I used the adhesive strips, not the tabs. Mounting instructions are very clear. It went on easily and sits right on the display with no bubbles.

The touchscreen actually works just fine. I don't need to use any additional pressure, so that's a positive. My advice? Get the largest one for your application and trim if necessary. That's a better situation than getting one that ostensibly ""fits"" but is then too small to use the adhesive strips, for example.

My display is already glossy, so I kept that look. The matte was too dim for me.

What I don't like:
Main thing is that the filter, whichever side it is one, reduces visual clarity and brightness, even from straight ahead. None of the images or text are as sharp as they are without the filter. Even with brightness cranked up all the way, it is probably about 70-80% of full bright with the filter in place. I assume it's due to the ""louvers"" they have in place to create the filters. This is, in my opinion the primary drawback of this item. I'll have to see how annoying it is over time, but must be noted.

A trade-off to having used the adhesive strips vs. the tabs is that this is less removable. What I mean is that the instructions say you can remove and replace, but it's clearly not intended to be removed every time you use your laptop. This means that it will be more annoying if I am watching a video or doing something requiring greater clarity or brightness to remove and replace with the adhesive tabs, so it will likely just stay on and I'll live with the reduced visual clarity.

The other thing I'm concerned about is where the pointer stick is. I already know it leaves a little mark on my display when I close my lid, even without the filter. I have confirmed it does the same with filter in place. The one thing I don't know is if it will cause a permanent indentation in the filter, or just a mark that can be wiped away. We'll see.

Note that I do not get the vertiical lines that some people say they get.

Overall, I like it, but be aware that it won't be as sharp and bright as without.

EDIT: I've tried pulling off the filter which was attached with the adhesive strips and it came off pretty easily. I was able to attach it and it seems pretty secure.

Any marks from the keyboard and pointer stick are easily wiped away.

The reduced clarity and brightness still annoy me at times, but reducing the brightness is actually an unexpected benefit when working on a plane with dimmed cabin lights. But the other 95% of the time, I wish it were a little brighter.

Our entire TV system was plugged into it, which includes the TV, a Roku player, a DVD player, an Amazon Fire stick, and a cable box, plus sometimes a laptop. It seemed to work fine; at least, I had peace of mind knowing things were protected.

Then a surge hit. A big one. A work crew hit the mains going into the house. Everything tripped, all the surge protectors, GFIs, and UPSs (of which we have many). One of our two service lines was cut or shorted, plus the neutral return, which meant power to the house was partially on but dangerously spiky. The utility came out and repaired the lines, but a couple house-side circuits remained blown out.

At any rate, of all the protective devices we had, this is the only one that started smoking, the only one that actually burned out *(SEE UPDATE BELOW), the only one that got very hot, and (notably) the only one that didn't have a reset. It's a good thing I was home to unplug it, or we could easily have had a fire.

Thing is, technically the product did its job: I think it protected everything that was plugged into it. (And if you read the fine print of the Belkin Lifetime Warranty, it only covers stuff plugged into the suppressor, not the suppressor itself unless it's defective.)

So a couple things. First, the joules rating on this 7-outlet SurgeMaster is 885; there's higher-rated protection out there for the dollar. Second, I think a reset switch is an essential feature: even lower-rated units simply tripped off instead of burning out, so had I not been home they would have been electrically disconnected, as opposed to this Belkin, which remained powered up and burning as long as there was power to the outlet.

When I shopped for a replacement, I bought something with a bit more protection and, most important, a trip switch, and I'd recommend that you do too.

UPDATE: Actually, it now seems two other strip surge suppressors (with reset buttons) also died. They lingered for a day or two after the spike, then slipped silently away. I'm keeping the rating on this one three stars, though, because, while the other two strip suppressors did die, they didn't nearly catch fire.","Well it worked. It sacrificed itself, but it worked.

I got this free as a review unit.  The problem is that I can't use it without spending some money for cables, as it does not come with cables.  StarTech says that's on purpose since people have different cable needs, especially different lengths. The cables that StarTech has available for it are over $21 each, which comes up to well over $60 for my 3 computers, almost the price of the switch.  With 4 computers connected, the price would be even more.  Okay, so they don't provide cables, but for the price of the switch, maybe they should at least give you a coupon or a voucher for one or two cables or a discount on the cables.  Interestingly the 2-port version does include cables; the 4-port does not.  StarTech's cables are nice, as they combine the needed USB with the VGA cable; otherwise you have to run two completely separate cables (one VGA cable for monitor and a USB cable for keyboard and mouse).  If you have USB cables as most people do, you can easily purchase the needed VGA cables inexpensively.  This brings me to the first real issue I have with this switch.  The master monitor connection is a female connector, which is standard.  Unfortunately the 4 computer monitor connectors are all male connections, so you can't use a standard male to male VGA cable that you would normally use from a computer to a monitor.  You have to get male to female VGA cables (which are typically called extension cables).  Why they would use this non-standard method of connecting monitors is puzzling.  A couple of reviewers were also concerned that this switch does not come with a power supply.  That's usually not a big deal as I found out that a power supply is not necessary, as the switch gets it's power from the USB connections.  There is no explanation as to why it has a place to plug in a power supply, although in some cases if you have a lot of USB devices connected to your PC, you might need additional power that a power supply would provide, so I assume it is for supplemental power.  It's good that they provide a way to add additional power, if you need it, even if not the actual power supply.  The next issue I encountered was trying to determine whether or not you could switch between computers with a hotkey sequence on your keyboard or whether you actually had to reach over to the switch and press the button for the computer you wanted.  Apparently there is no keyboard switching or if there is, no one seems to know what keys are used.  I read the manual for the setup and was concerned that it states that for PC to get the switch to work properly, a couple of BIOS settings for PC need to be changed.  I am not even sure that my computers have those particular settings, especially my older computers that sometimes have more limited BIOS settings available.  I have had 3 other KVM switches and none of them needed a change to BIOS settings.  Given the problems that others have had with this switch in that it doesn't always work flawlessly, I am not sure that I want to take time to test it right, since I already have a nicely working KVM switch.  I still have to buy cables.  On the plus side, this switch appears to be well built with a metal case; not cheap plastic.  It appears to be nice and solid and just heavy enough.  If the issues I mentioned are not a deal-breaker for you, I think this is worth trying.

The Star Tech 2 Port Professional USB KVM Switch met this need for me.

I was extremely happy to have found the StarTech as a solution to this issue.

My only issue is there is a slight delay in response time when I switch.  This is the only issue I have currently with this product. I can't see this issue warranting me lowering the star rating from 5 to 4 due to this.

This product comes with two VGA and USB combo cables ( connected together as one cable) .
My husband set this up for me and he says that the setup was a breeze.  It was plug and play setup, meaning no need to install or download any software.

 I uploaded a picture of the back and front of the StarTech 2 Port Professional USB KVM Switch in case it helps .

On the picture of the back, notice my glittery dongle ?  I painted it with nail polish so I could tell which dongle went with which mouse.  This was how I ensured that I grabbed the correct dongle for the mouse I was using when I had to travel.  I won't have this issue anymore!

My monitors are setup to duplicate the desktop , not mirror or extend the desktop so I can have separate views on each monitor.  To accomplish this I have two docks ( one dell and one universal ) and each laptop uses one HDMI and one VGA.  My two monitors have both a VGA and a HDMI cable connected to them.  I switch sources on the monitor to designate which laptop I need.  With my current setup, I have the flexibility to duplicate the desktop of one laptop on both monitors or  view each laptop separately on the two monitors at the same time ( one laptop on each monitor ).",I have needed this forever!,1482710400.0

I had three computers and a laptop display port out to manage.  Before the StarTech solution, I had keyboards, mice, monitors, confusing cables, etc. all over the place.  It was a mess.  Here's what I discovered hooking all this up.

But before I go into the advantages and disadvantages, let me start out with a serious annoyance.  There is no manual, just a sliver of paper telling you to go online to download it.  The problem with this is that without the internet, the end user will have no way to learn of the hotkeys to switch this device.  This information should have been included in the box:

USEFUL HOTKEYS (not explained unless the user goes online):

Left <CTRL> + Left <CTRL> + <1>
This will switch to input 1.  Use 2, 3, 4 to go to the other inputs

Left <CTRL> + Left <CTRL> + <F5>
This turns audio follow on and off.  Useful if you want to listen to music on one device and switch to another.

There are several others, so go download the manual online if you end up buying this device.  Otherwise you will not even be aware of the full potential.

WARRANTY:  Nice 3 year parts and labor.

DISADVANTAGES:
- Computers that do not support Display Port technology are sort of a pain if you need to drive 2560x1600.  When looking for an adapter or special cable on amazon, I discovered that the type of converter that supports this bandwidth is about $40.  For that price, I just bypassed the switch and went straight into the monitor with a DVI cable.

-  No manual!

ADVANTAGES:
-  Supports resolutions up to 2560 x 1600 @ 60Hz.  Perfect my use.

-  Works great with RF wireless keyboards and mice.  Switched immediately with no problems at all.

-  Supports 7.1 audio channels and microphone.

-  Several hotkeys that allow the user to customize how the switch functions.  There are no on-screen controls, however, so other than the beeps of the device the user cannot query the state.

CONCLUSION:  This a pretty bare-bones KVM switch that does it's job well.  You get no bells and whistles at all, not even a manual.  But it works and it works at a high 2560 x 1400 resolution.  It's not beautiful, but it's its not ugly either.  It looks like something you would find in a computer rack, and even has an optional rack mount kit for those in a data center.

I was initially disappointed that the Startech SV231DPU2 did not seem to support the 4K resolutions I am used to. I had only managed to get the resolutions as indicated in the instruction manual (2560 x 1600), and was unable to get Windows to change resolution beyond that. I had thought that I was using my monitor within the specification of 3840 x 2160 @ 30Hz. However, after looking into the issue, I was surprised to notice that I was running at 60Hz. Well, Windows display settings did not allow me to change to a 4K @ 30Hz. Only 59 or 60. However, I was able to change the settings on the graphics cards to reflect the 30Hz maximum that the Startech switch can handle. I initially thought that the cables were not compatible, but I was wrong. So, here's the review:

Pros:
- 4K @ 30Hz Compatible.
- Effective switch control through one single button.
- Steel housing and enough heft to stay in place on desk.
- PnP and needed no driver updates.

Cons:
- Potentially not compatible with all 4K setups, depending on graphic card.

I would list the potential of awkward setups, given the placement of the ports in both front and back as a con as well as the fact that 4K is only available at 30Hz, but that's already something noticeable in the pictures and description of the product, so we already kind of know what we're getting into.

If anyone bothered to read the previous review I left, they would have seen that I had said that it had potential and was a nice little thing, missing a key component. Since I have not had the ability to test out the unit for long term, I cannot comment on the long term viability of the product, but it has a 2 year warranty, and that's not bad, particularly for the price. It's easy to switch sources and really, that's all I need out of a KVM switch.

So, I changed from 2 to 5 Stars, and, should it not last the two years, will make an appropriate edit. Thanks for reading!","Initial Disappointment, but Won Over.",1470009600.0

I read elsewhere on here where someone said you could plug this into the top socket of your wall plug and it would leave the bottom plug free. That is not the case. This has a prong that sticks out the middle that is designed to fit into the ground (third prong of a three-prong plug) of the top outlet while it plugs in normally and gets its power from the bottom plug outlet.

If you removed that middle plastic prong from this so you could plug it into the top plug on the wall, it would lose much of it's stability that helps keep it from easily falling off the wall. I've seen other plug mounted surge protectors like this that actually require you to remove the middle screw and cover plate on the wall sockets and then they come with a much longer middle screw that you use to attach it and keep it even more securely in place. I prefer the method this Tripp Lite uses as it holds well enough and you don't have to worry about misplacing a wall plate and screw if you ever decide to remove the surge protector because they don't need to be removed with this type of design.

If I could change one thing about this surge protector it would be to have one one side of the plugs be meant to plug items in horizontally and the opposite side to face the other directions so items could be plugged int vertically. Depending on the design of power bricks they'll often cover up a plug above/below it while if the plugs were all going the other direction, it would leave the ones next to it open.

I personally use a number of these Tripp Lite units, but do not rely on them as primary protection.

The most common surges are caused by in house equipment - my house for example has two sump pumps and a sewage ejector pump, and surges from these pumps travel throughout my house because all circuits are connected at the main breaker panel. In terms of total surge current, these are small surges, and a point of use protector such as this probably does a good job protecting whatever is connected. The bigger, but far more infrequent surges are caused by things like lightning strikes, downed power lines, and other major changes in overall power usage in the grid. These surges can easily exceed the 36 kA/600 joule capacity of this device. That is not what it is designed to protect against.

I personally use two levels of protection: a whole house protector, rated at 108 kA at my main load center, and then these at point of use. The whole house protector will protect against major surges originating outside my home, and also internal surges traveling from one circuit inside my house to another. The smaller ones protect against anything that gets past the whole house protector and any surges originating in the same circuit as the appliance. A whole house protector is relatively inexpensive  and can be installed by anyone that has some basic experience doing electrical work; if you choose to use an electrician (I didn't), it would cost about an hour of labor at most. You will need two adjacent empty slots in your load center so both 110 V phases are protected. Many very reputable companies (Eaton, Siemens, Cutler Hammer for example) make these. Even with this, I know that I will not be protected against the extremely unlikely occurrence of a direct or very close lightning strike, because that could be several hundred thousand amps and easily exceed the protection capability of any surge protector, but I suppose that is what I pay my home insurance provider for.

In summary, use these, but know what they can and cannot do, and plan accordingly. Don't rely on a manufacturer warranty to pay for your fried TV, microwave, or fridge; no surge protector manufacturer makes money from paying out warranty claims. And make sure to also protect your cable and telephone lines - I once lost a TV to a surge that traveled through the coaxial cable.",Know its limitations and use accordingly,1488672000.0

Surge protectors come a dozen a dollar (literally) and folks seeking quality brands imho are the ones who understand that surges do happen or have gone through the experience of untimely replacing large electronics like the TV.

Having said that there is really only one thing you need to look at when considering surge protectors and it's not its joules rating: warranty.  Coverage of damage through a power surge by a reputable brand once and if and only if the product was timely registered will yield you the only kind of insurance you might be happy to deal with.  Beyond that, it's the features you want to look into and that's where this particular Tripp Lite comes into play.  I'll just break it down to pros and cons.

Pros: Tripp Lite offers an unique feature where the plug will stop working once the surge protection has worn off (yes they do wear off).  If you do a little research you'll find that it is often recommend replacing surge protectors once every 5-6 years or otherwise treat it like a normal plug extender should you choose to use it beyond those years.  Tripp Lite has come up with a ""smarter"" solution that may sounds a heck of a lot like planned obsolescence but it does fulfill a need for those using high end equipment that cannot afford a down time (like servers).  This is also a way for me to lazily confirm whether there really are power surges in my area (some have a lot and others very little or none at all) and while it's prudent to look this up for your area I find this to be an unique way to test this question for my own home specifically.  If this surge protector lasts me forever I know I'll never have to worry about lightnings and I'll just use my old prongs in more confidence.

Cons: Some users have complained about the filmsy build of the surge protector.  I found it to be fine.  Also it's not a Belkin or a APC with the best warranties known to also pay off if and when the time comes but once again after years of living in ignorance of all this and having not gone through any issues I'm leaning towards NOT having to deal with an actual surge.  One minor gripe is that it does not have a USB charging port for my ever growing needs to power a Roku or Chromecast behind my TV but I suspect this might be a passing thing in lieu of USB ports showing up in TVs as well.

Wirecutter, a website I like to frequent recommend after doing a lot of the leg work for you so I recommend looking up their post before making a decision.  Also this is the first surge protector I've purchased probably in years and it was to go with the new TV I just got (I subscribe to the philosophy of new wineskin for new wine).

Now that I bought this, at least once a week I loose all connection and have to reboot the darn equipment. So about 3 years ago I got a security system and camera put on my home. This required them to attach equipment to my computer and run cables through my modem. The problem is, I only had one port on my modem and one port on the back of my computer. The tech said there are two solutions, buy a router at my own expense or he could run the cables from the modem to their modem, then to the computer. This worked but it slowed down my high speed internet. I have put up with this for 3 years and finally had enough.
After searching for a long time I found this low cost unit in Amazon and was skeptical until I read the most positive reviews which said it worked great and was basically plug and go. At first after hooking everything up, nothing would work so I decided to reset both of the modems and when I did that, everything worked fine. I am skilled enough that I did not need any help but if you do, right on the side of the box their is a 24 hour help line or you can use the included step by step disc to help you along. Otherwise, I think you will be happy.
The one thing I did not like and reason for only 4 stars is, there are four ports and one WAN where you plug in the cable for the modem.

5,46.0,False,2017-08-10,A3N5OADG9WESRB,B00006I53W,{'Style:': ' Base'},Wigged Out Fat Guy,"I would like to do 3 things here.  First I will review the 70-200mm F2.8 lens and then offer some cheaper recommendations for those that might benefit just as well from a less expensive lens.  Also, I want to discuss the differences between the four different versions of this lens and the different situations they are useful.

Ive got a lot to say, so lets pro-con this thing.

Pros (there are a lot)
1. Sharp  Without a doubt, image sharpness is important on a lens, for many it is the most important quality.  This is one of the sharpest zoom lenses Canon makes.  Ill let the images do the rest of the talking on this subject.
2. Constant F2.8  With most telephoto lenses, you will lose light as you zoom.  I don't want to get into the science behind why (at least not in the review), but the point is that this lens does not.  It keeps the same wide F2.8 aperture no matter what focal length you choose, which makes it very useful in any light (I.E., indoor sports).
3. Bokeh  Speaking of F2.8, the wide aperture creates some pretty eye pleasing bokeh.  This is one of the many qualities that make this such a good lens for portraits, or just about anything.
4. Blazing fast AF  Ultrasonic motors are well known for their speedy autofocus.  This one has ridiculously fast AF.  When I got mine, the next best lens I owned was the 55-250mm, and the AF speed comparison between them was no contest.  The first time I hit that half press and saw how fast it nailed the focus, I actually flinched!  The guy at the shop laughed and told me I wasn't the first hed seen react that way.  If you have never had a pro-level lens before, it might make you flinch too.  It also has a focus limiter to help keep the focus fast when you aren't super close to your subject.  TIP  If you find that suddenly you cant AF, then it is likely your limiter is set to 3m-infinity, or 9.8 feet for those not on metric.  Flip the limiter to 1.5m-infinity when you start to get close, but even then, you cant get real close (see the cons for more details).
5. Low-light  Works very well in low light, thanks to the aforementioned F2.8 aperture.  Take a look at the squirrel photos I have posted.  Some were taken at dusk, with the sun barely poking out over the horizon, on a Rebel T3i.  It looks more like overcast, with diffused rather than diminished light.  Its good indoors too; if you want to take indoor shots of sport with little to no noise, this is the lens.
6. Extender Compatible  Works with both the 1.4x and 2x extenders by Canon.  Keep in mind the drawbacks of using an extender, in addition to minor IQ loss, you also lose light.  The 1.4x drops you to F4 and the 2x drops you to F5.6.  Even at F5.6, it can still AF.  With the 2x on, this lens becomes a 140-400mm lens, and has comparable IQ to the 100-400mm lens.  Slap that on an APS-C like the 80D or the 7D, and now you have that tight framing to go with it, making it pretty good for wildlife.  I think the Kenko extenders work too, though I have not tested.
7. Portraits!  For those not in the know, this is a really good portrait lens.  The basic rundown here is that the compression the lens gives creates a flattering look on your model, especially for headshots.  Add in the bokeh effect, and you have some pretty good portraits.  Keep in mind though, if you are using an APS-C camera the bokeh effect is not as strong as on a full frame, but is still pretty good.
8. No focus breathing  200mm is 200mm, unlike the Tamron and the Sigma versions of the lens.  This is important for video shooters as well as portrait photographers.
9. Other stuff  L level glass with 4 UD elements to reduce chromatic aberrations.  Solid case made of steel.  Hood is included, and is felt covered on the inside.  Tripod ring and carry bag are also included.  Focus window is built into the lens.  Metal threads for the filter.  Overall, its just a great lens, and a worthwhile investment.

Cons (Since all these things are listed specs for the lens, I am not taking any stars off for them, but they are worth pointing out.  Knowing what you are buying and the way to use it is on the user.)

1. Price  Right at the top of the list, the price.  This lens is expensive.  This is due to the steel build of the case and all the glass that is packed into it, as well as its intended use.  L lenses are meant for a higher level of photography, or in more direct terms, as an investment.  They are either for people that make money from their photos, or at least take their hobby very seriously.  Think hard before dropping the money on this lens.  If it will cost more than your entire current setup up, then I would say take a look at one of my other recommendations later in the review, or ask yourself how far you want to go with photography.  I always liked taking pictures, but it wasn't until I had the 70-200mm F2.8 that I really started to love it (along with an upgrade to the 80D).  I wanted to branch out to more things.  And to be fair, the lens holds value fairly well; you can sell it used for about 850-900 USD.  A loss to be sure, but not a bad one.
2. Weight  Holy Jeebus this lens is heavy.  If you only have the neck strap that came with your camera, then do yourself a favor and get something else.  I have a few different setups, based on what I am doing.  I have a rapid strap for general walk around use.  I have a Lowepro Toploader Pro 75 AW II for extended use when I will only need this lens and my camera, plus one more lens.  And then I have my Lowepro ProTactic 450 AW backpack, where the camera fits in the side access point (like a sling bag), and then has room for all my other gear too.  I once carried this around the zoo for a day on the neck strap, and well, never again.
3. Minimum Focus is 1.5m/4.9ft  You won't get very close to anything with this lens, not without tube extenders.  Ive never used them on this lens, since I have never really needed to use it for that purpose, so I cant report on their effectiveness.  I have gotten so close I couldn't AF anymore, at least not without switching the limiter.  So, why not always leave the limiter at 1.5m?  Because it slows down AF at longer distances, but that really only matters for action type shots.  If you are not shooting action then its fine at 1.5m.
4. Not Weather Sealed  At least not fully sealed.  There is no gasket at the base to make a full seal on the camera, but the rings and the switches are sealed from moisture and dust.  But when you consider that this is a pro-level lens and cost 1250 USD, it feels kind like a gyp.  I know this was the first version of this lens (released in 1995), but come on Canon, get us a sealed version of this lens!  We don't all need IS, and pro level lenses should be weather sealed.  I mean, how much is that gasket?  Cant be much
5. No IS  Speaking of IS, this one does not have it.  This is part of the reason why it is so much less expensive than the IS II version (also that lens has more glass in it for better IQ).  I talk more about this later, but not everyone needs IS.  To clear up a common misconception, IS is only useful for countering hand shakiness at low shutter speeds (1/60 sec or slower), it does nothing to freeze motion.  To do that, you have to shoot at high shutter speeds, like 1/500 or 1/1000 sec, depending on what you are shooting.  At those speeds, handshake will not be an issue, since the shutter is reflexing so fast.  In fact, at those speeds, IS is a hindrance, since it takes a moment for the motor to kick in.  It is brief, but at those speeds, every bit of time counts.  So if you are shooting a lot of action shots or from a tripod, then IS is an overpriced luxury.  If you are looking to get paid to make portraits, then I would say pony up the extra cash and get the F2.8 IS II instead, as it is a more solid investment for that purpose.
6. Other Stuff  77mm filter thread, means expensive filters if you are into that.  I use a UV filter on mine, and have a circular polarizer that I regret buying for it (never use it).  Focus ring is placed where you would likely hold the lens, and with full manual override in AF mode you can accidentally move the ring.  Not too big a deal, you get used to holding it so that this doesnt happen.  I leave the ring mount on at all times and prop the lens up with that.  Hood is expensive to replace at 50 bucks.  Mine is pretty worn out, and will need replaced soon, but it is several years old, and sees a TON of action!

Again, all these cons are part of the listed specs and in my opinion do not warrant the removal of any stars.  It would be like rating an F4 lens 4 out of 5 stars because it can only go to F4.

So in conclusion, I have not regretted buying this lens, even though I am not a paid professional.  I fall into the category of the enthusiast; someone that has a high level of technical understanding and skill, and is very passionate about photography but otherwise doesnt get paid.  I was able to justify this to myself because I wanted to get more action shots.  Things like squirrels, ducks, geese, deer, or any other animal on the run.  I wanted to be able to shoot my nieces volleyball games (which she unfortunately was done with by the time I had the money to buy the lens).  It was a nice bonus to find out that it makes a wonderful portrait lens; though you do need to be fairly steady to do that by hand with this monster (the IS II is definitely better for that).  I had a T3i, which was great, but the AF system and burst mode just were not up to the task.  That is why I got my 80D.  So, if you are a Rebel user, and are looking at this lens, just keep in mind that it might be more lens than you need.  Here are 2 great lenses that I would suggest you give some thought to first

1. EF-S 55-250mm F4-5.6 IS STM  While not a true portrait lens, this lens is a fine one for its price of 300 USD.  And it does great just about everywhere else too; sharp, fairly quick and quiet AF, IS, lightweight, and even though the barrel extends during zoom and focus, the front element does not rotate.  For APS-C users, this is possibly the best lens for under a grand.  Full frame users need not apply, since it won't fit on those cameras.
2. EF 70-300mm F4-5.6 IS II USM  This lens and the 55-250mm have nearly identical IQ and features.  The main differences are that this one has 50mm of extra reach, has a neat little LCD display, and is compatible with APS-C as well as full frame cameras.  However, it is also 200 dollars more at 500 USD.

I don't want to get to far into it since this is not a review for those lenses, but if you are not looking to drop more money on a lens then you have in your whole setup, then either of those will work well.  They are not as universally good as the 70-200 F2.8, but they are much less expensive.  Just make sure you have plenty of light.

Lastly, I want to talk about all the different versions of the 70-200mm there are, and the scenarios they are useful.  It seems pretty common that people are sometimes confused about these lenses, and I want to help them make a better decision before spending so much money.

The F4 non-IS  There was a time I would have said, This is the best bang for your buck telephoto for less than 1000 dollars.  And while it is still a really good and sharp lens, I have started to recommend the previously mentioned 55-250mm and 70-300mm instead.  For a lower price, you can have very good image quality, IS, and a longer reach, albeit at the sacrifice of a stop at the long ends.  For the price, I would cut my teeth on one of those, while saving for one of the more expensive F2.8 models.
The F4 IS  Popular amongst nature photographers, this lens adds IS to the F4 model.  Like all its brothers, it is sharp with a fast AF.  Nature shooters like it because they can shoot at slower shutter speeds without the aid of a tripod, thanks to the IS.  For action though, it has the same drawbacks as any lens that cant open up any further than F4; it can only shoot action in really good light.  Anything indoors is out without a flash.  For 1150 USD, I would rather carry a tripod/monopod and one of the F2.8 models.  But if you are only shooting slow shots anyway, then this is a good value lens.
F2.8 non-IS  The oldest model on this list (and the one in this review), this lens was originally released in 1995, and has been one of Canons flagship lenses ever since.  Outdone only by the more recent IS version, this lens has exceptional performance.  Depending on your intended use, it can be a bargain for you.  If most of your shots will be action shots, no matter the light, then this is your lens for 700 dollars less than the IS ii (1250 vs 1950).  Some people prefer the F4 IS for 100 bucks less, but here are my thoughts on that.  For the money, I would take the F2.8 any day.  I can find a way to steady my shot (tripod, monopod, sturdy surface), but F4 can never be F2.8.  I would only go with the F4 version if more than 50% of my shots would need to be at slow shutter speeds, requiring the IS.
F2.8 IS ii  The big dog of the block, this guy is pricey, but awesome.  A true pros tool, it is versatile for so many things.  The latest model, the IS ii, has improved optics over the other models, for even sharper IQ, though I question the level a person can even perceive the difference.  The IS can be a big advantage, offering 4 stops of assistance with one of the more modern versions Canon makes.  It is very expensive though, at 1950 USD.  It combines together the best elements of just about any lens you would want, save for a longer reach or wider angle of view.  But I would not suggest it to just anyone.  If you don't make a living from your photography, then put some serious thought into this before buying it.  I personally had a hard time justifying the non-IS version, since I am not a pro.  But I now have images I never could have made with my other lenses, not without a lot of luck and perfect conditions.

Thats all I got.  All that is left is to check out the images.  Thanks for reading my review!","Not everyone needs IS, a bargain for those that don't!",1502323200.0

Pros:
- They sound okay and feel good at first.
- They're ported so you can hear outside noise while listening - like if your kids are wearing them and you talk to them - they can hear you.
- They perform in line or better for their price point IMO.
- Koss, as with all of their phones, will happily fix them for free or replace them for life so long as you're willing to pay the shipping.

Cons:
- Seriously uncomfortable after about an hour. You will never be able to use these for extended listening.
- Because they are ported - you can hear ambient sounds - which may or may not be a good thing - but also - anyone else in the room can easily hear what you are listening to which can get quite annoying at times. Gotta leave the room if you are reading or trying to concentrate on something.
- Cabling is a proven failure point on these. Not for children - they will screw up the cabling within weeks (or sooner if they fall asleep with them on -
 they'll screw up the tiny fragile wiring in a New York minute) - had to send them back twice - and Koss just sent a brand new set back. At the current price point - probably not worth the shipping (certainly not twice). With conscientious adult use, cabling may not be an issue.
- The way they fold up is a PITA due to the wires. There's just no good way.

BOTTOM LINE IMO - for just about twice the price (Koss ProDJ200) you'll get:
- A noticeably better audio response - I mean noticeably.
- All day wearability with regards to comfort.
- Detachable cabling such that you'll never have to deal with broken wiring/cabling.
- Better build quality with notably higher quality materials (you can actually feel it in the weight - metal vs. plastic).
- Earmuffs articulate rotationally. Certainly a bonus ""IF"" you have a use for that.
- Included AUX cabling - one straight with controls - one coily without.
- A handy carrying case for frustration free and protected long and short term stowage. No crazy spaghetti wiring to mess with or worry about.
- No one can hear what you are listening to because they are NOT ported. Perhaps this contributes to the more premium audio response. But by and large, you're not going to be bothering other people in the room with your loud music. And you won't be able to hear them either (good or bad)

Moore,"Like EVERYONE else on here, I was looking for a reasonably priced replacement for my beloved Sony headphones which I'd been buying and replacing for decades.  I don't like the idea of paying more than $10 for a set of portable headphones as they don't last forever and, frankly, I""m not easy on them.

So here's my 2 cents in case you're also looking to replace your Sonys.  These are not the headphones you're looking for.  As mentioned in other reviews, they don't have a natural arc to fit the head as comfortably or securely as the Sonys and they aren't the ""side firing"" set up to send the sound into your ear canal.  As a result, the sound has a distant tunnel quality...something that the Sony earphones never had unless they were improperly secured.  There is a tendency towards a tinny, overly-treble sound, and not the satisfying bass of the Sony.

For the record...they're better than the Dollar Tree alternative...but if you like pure, clear sound, you will be disappointed.  I know that's a lot to expect from cheap earphones...but the old Sonys delivered with great sound at a cheap price.  Keep these in your backpack for an emergency but invest in better ones for those moments when sound is key.",So not Sony,1471392000.0
5,5.0,False,2017-09-09,A2PMIMM3U3THM7,B00006JPDI,,vqworks,"If you've read most of the numerous reviews on this speaker about its high value, it is very true.  In fact, at the price you don't have a right to expect audiophile sound quality (or audio nitpicker) at all.  Yet they definitely qualify as audiophile speakers even at this price.  I was lucky enough to purchase my first pair years ago for a bedroom mini component stereo system.  As usual, the speakers that came with the system were deficient in bass and treble.  Like virtually all original mini system speakers my Pioneer speakers were only listenable when I used the bass and treble controls to boost these sounds and, even then, they increased the mid to upper bass which lead to boom (terrible).  The BIC DV62si came to the rescue.

Eventually, I found out that this model existed for over 27 years after I read a back issue of Stereo Review Magazine from 1990!  BIC was definitely wise to keep it in their Venturi line.  Having been so satisfied with my first pair of DV62si speakers, I recently decided to purchase a second pair over the Labor Day holiday for my daughter's mini system.  With the Labor Day discount and free shipping the total came out to just $110.  The DV62si came through again!

So how do the DV62si speakers sound?  Many reviewers commented that they were bright.  Some also stated that a break-in period is required for the exaggerated treble to mellow out.  I share the same experience.

But keep the following details in mind.  The highs that reviewers are referring to are the upper midrange/lower treble.  Some adventurous and fairly knowledgeable buyers open them up to alter the electronic crossover.  I don't recommend this option because it's not necessary since the tonal balance will fix itself over about a months usage (the manufacturer apparently took this into account when designing the speakers.  The other issue that arises with this option, of course, is that you would void BIC's warranty.

After a month's usage, the speakers will sound very close to optimal.  Although the speakers are somewhat large for bookshelf speakers, the bass is very extended (not exaggerated).  So they sound much larger than they really are without any undesirable bass boom.  I would at least partially attribute this to the beveled front edges of of the cabinet.  More impressive is the fact that the bass does not sound boxy, which is usually a given at this price.  In fact, all the other bookshelf speakers I've heard under $200 have been afflicted by a boxy sound.  Not these!  These simply have a solid and extended bass that you simply wouldn't expect for the price.  If your music has fairly deep bass in it, you'll be surprised by an occasional wallop of bass.  The bass is not subterranean (not physically possibly for the size) but it's extended enough for nearly all instrumental music.  The exception being organ pedals (32Hz), electronic, or modern hip hop, in which case you'd want to use a good subwoofer.  The bottom line is that, if you're not a bass fanatic, you won't miss the bottom octave of audible bass (20 Hz to 40 Hz).

The midrange has a nice open quality to it with a lot of energy.  If the source signal is dynamic, you'll hear it.  Vocals and instruments have a nicely balanced midrange that projects well yet it can lunge at you when required to do so.  The best part of it is that there's no pinched or nasal quality to the midrange.  This is extremely hard to avoid at the price but DV62si manages to do it.

After a month of usage, the lower-treble is audibly more tame and manages to avoid the harsh quality that reviewers often mention.  It's still a touch prominent but not enough to distract you unless the particular song you're listening to has prominent and percussive lower-treble like closely miked rim shots or cymbal strikes recorded hot (with boosted treble) in the studio.

What other reviewers have not commented on is the imaging ability of these speakers.  The stereo image that these speakers project are certainly adequate.  But this is where they call attention to their low price.  The image is restricted to the listening height and width of the speakers.  Higher-priced audiophile bookshelf speakers (normally over $300) will also give you a sense of palpable depth and maybe even project an image that is somewhat wider than the distance of the speakers.  In any case, if you've never experienced such qualities you won't miss them anyway.  If you have, you'll immediately know what I'm referring to.  Some brands like KEF's Q-series are known for an extremely enveloping image, which can be addictive.  But that's at a higher price.

The overall sound quality of these speakers, after taking into account the one-month break-in period for taming the lower-treble, is a well-balanced sound with just a touch of boosted lower-treble.  There is a dynamic, punchy overall quality to the sound with palpable and extended bass along with smooth, open midrange so vocals and instruments project well.  The speakers are also efficient so you can power them with lower-powered amplifiers or receivers without any difficulties.  Drive them loud and they'll still sound clean without any rude noises.

At the price, the fit and finish of the speakers are also quite good.  The laminated finish covers every side of the speaker.  Unlike many other budget bookshelf speakers, there are no exposed pressed wood fibers on the back or anywhere else.  This is quite an achievement.

In fact, at this price we don't have a right to expect good sound or decent construction.  But with these speakers we definitely get them in spades.

These speakers would be at home in a small or large component system or a home theater on stands.  They're magnetically shielded so they can be placed next to TV screens in cramped rooms without the risk of discoloring the picture.  In a home theater in large room, the slightly prominent lower-treble would be a real asset because large rooms tend to diffuse or weaken the treble.  In such a setup, you'll need to choose a subwoofer that can reproduce the lowest octave of bass.  There are many so-called subwoofers that are technically not subwoofers (just bass modules) since their bass doesn't extend much lower than the DV62si's (rated at 43Hz).  At the very least, you'd likely need a subwoofer with a 10"" or larger driver so that the bass can extend well under 40Hz.",A Real Audiophile Budget Speaker!,1504915200.0

Anyway I received the BIC's sooner than expected! I was surprised at the weight & they ARE very similar to the Minimus 7; The grille is aluminum mesh, like the Minimus, but also has cloth covering;
I like the different positions of the keyholes so the speakers can be hung in 3 different positions;
Before hanging I gently pried the name plate (which is plastic & glued to grille) off to invert it!
I hung these upside down on a post & wall as close to the ceiling as possible so they're angling downward for my surround speakers; I made a template using duct tape with holes located in the top of the keyholes, which made it easy to hang, & left enough room from the ceiling to slip the speaker onto the screws;
I also placed four 3/8"" furniture felt pads on the back of the speakers to keep them off the wall/post, so I adjusted the screw depth to accommodate the extra depth on the back; they fit virtually perfect & look great!
I hooked them up to my DENON AVR & ran the auto setup so that the distance & levels, both volume & frequencies were adjusted;
Now with these as surround & the Minimus 7 set as surround back I've got beautiful 7.1 sound!

Now I have a five dollar thrift shop Sony receiver that ebay says is worth eight hundred and it's like twenty years old.  I don't like it and it's only worth five bucks in my eyes and weighs like forty pounds.  That being said the speakers sound good with my mp3 player plugged into my stereo but not amazing like the pair of 301 series 2 sounded like when I was kid.  But I will blame it on my receiver, I have to turn it almost all the way up to get any decent sound and you would think that is loud but it's not, it's really not with this receiver.  Movies from my direct tv box come through louder and then my stereo volume can only be half way otherwise too loud.  Movies sound worse than mp3's.  It's just not that full rich sound I was looking for and expected from owning a pair of these thirty years ago.  I had a 440 watt amp back then though and a marantz sr1000 receiver with a jvc eqa.  So I was able to adjust the sound and had the power to have tremendous clarity with a decent receiver to control it all.  I give the speakers four stars because even though I'm not getting the movie tv sound I was hoping for it doe's jam with the mp3 player and sounds good for most softer stuff, but not impressed at all with thumping music with them.  Kid rock has a couple songs that sound ok but most do not.  Treble overpowers the bass almost always and despite moving them from place to place and yes on the floor I had the most bass but not as good room filling sound.  Also this odd shape unlike my old set doesn't really allow for securely placing them on their sides like I used to be able to do.  I have a cat and their on bar stools now and it seems like their just too wabbly with tweeter end straight up placement.  I am getting a lot more bass than with my four inch bass driven jbl bookshelves and without having a new receiver to give a better opinion on if they just don't make them like they used to or yes it was the crappy old receiver I have.  I have tried adjusting the receiver with it's million controls and adjustments from hall, theater, jazz, etc, high pass on and off, and bass, treble & midrange controls, etc to fine tune it and as I said it's just ok sounding and not the way I want it to sound.  I'm hoping it's not the speakers and will be replacing my receiver hopefully in the next year.  Overall I rate them as it is now at 3.75 - 4.25 out of 5 star rating.

CABLE LENGTH: The 4-port USB-only switch I got came with 2x 4' (nearer 3'6"") cables and 2x 6' (5'6"") cables. This is probably a great idea, to minimize excess cable while still providing the ability to reach all machines. Had it been all 4' cables, the switch would definitely have been returned. I'd have preferred all 6'ers as I didn't discover the difference until I had already (mis)marked them. The cable lengths are clearly marked on the packaging; they should be listed here in the product description as well.
SWITCHING: direct button access to any port, much better than stepping thorough, and an LED by each button tells you who's up. Also supports stepping via the keyboard, by tapping the Scroll Lock key twice, for those cases where it's not easy to reach.
FUNCTION: Unlike PS/2, each time the keyboard and mouse are connected and disconnected, Windows reacts to this. The result is a small lag before it's usable. If you're set up for Num Lock always on, this is easy. Just wait 'till it lights, you're ready to go. Typically, you'll also hear an alert tone from Windows for each device as is connects and disconnects. So it should not be a problem, unless you can't afford that >1 sec wait. The problem with PS/2 style KVMs is that, since at least Win 7 and even Win XP, once you switch away, on many poorer KVMs, the mouse was gone and would not be re-detected. Have not seen this at all here, and the nature of USB should ensure it's no longer a problem.

This 40-disc case is only marginally larger than 40 discs. It releases discs easily (it's easy to reach in and pull one out), yet one could literally toss it around (I don't,) with little worry.
 I have seldom used or had interest in CD wallet / book things; discs of friends who use them always show some amount of scratching. Further, I prefer to handle discs only by their edges, which is usually not possible when removing discs from the tight sleeves in typical cases. For me, that outweighs any convenience. So no CD wallet for me.
 My view changed 5 or 10 years ago when I ran into some of these at a thrift store (in red!). I think I bought one and took it home before deciding that it was different from, and superior to other CD cases I had seen. I went back and bought all that they had, (about five of them). Since then I have been so impressed that I have periodically sought to get more. I could never find any, and I kind of thought that discgear might have closed shop. I decided that if I ever found more, I would buy them out. The other day, I found these!
 The revolutionary difference: While most cases are like 3-ring binders, this is an accordion folder. (More like two of them, actually. Turning it upside down reaches a 2nd set of discs.)
 This review is kind of rough and incomplete. I will write a more thorough (read: longer), and polished (shorter) review when I have time.

They are heavy, and you will need to use a very good tripod to support them.  You may need to factor in at least another $100 to the cost of acquisition, and more if you're tall.  I suppose you could sit in a lawn chair and use the binoculars with your arms resting on your chest, but even a strong person is going to tire quickly.  The view you get through these binoculars is better than one would get from a telescope at the same price point, and the optics gather a lot of light.  There is some chromatic aberration near the edges of the lenses, but it is slight, and doesn't interfere with the detail.  Astronomical binoculars, like telescopes, require a little practice, patience, and care to provide the best views.  These binoculars are easier to set up than a telescope, easier to put in your car and head out into the dark, easier to focus, and easier to look through, but they are still astronomical binoculars.

I don't recommend these for most kids, as they are too heavy and require a non-trivial amount of strength to place and secure them on a tripod.  I would only purchase these for someone who has an obvious serious interest in amateur astronomy.  The other thing that kids, and some adults, do is grab onto the binoculars while viewing, and then complain that they can't see anything.  I'm not a parent, and I can only stand about 9 seconds of some kid, or adult for that matter, whining about the view before I start seriously thinking about packing stuff up and going home.  Ordinary field binoculars, mounted on a tripod, will provide extremely good views of many celestial objects, are much more kid-friendly, and generally make better gifts.

Addendum: I purchased a heavy duty video pan-tilt head for the tripod, and mount the SkyMaster binocs on that.  Here is the one I purchased: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017LEESA

The binoculars are MUCH easier to manipulate with the pan head.  But the pan head itself is heavy, so make sure your tripod.  The Orion heavy duty parallelogram looks like it might be better, but you need to drop another $500 to get that.  If you already have a decent tripod, the pan head is about half the price of the parallelogram.

They are available under many different brand names but all of them are garbage.  (As a side note nothing wrong with them being Chinese necessarily, some of the best binoculars on the market these days are Chinese manufactured.  In this case though the design of these is fundamentally flawed and can't properly hold collimation.)

For binoculars ""collimation"" refers to the images from the two eyepieces lining up to form a single merged image.  They eye can tolerate some misalignment and force the images to merge but this can cause fatigue and eyestrain.  Too much misalignment and the eyes give up and we see double images.  Collimation is typically more critical for astronomy viewing rather than terrestrial viewing so it is amusing that Celestron is marketing one of the worst collimated binoculars in the market for astronomy... Kind of a cruel joke.

I gave these a try when they were on sale to see if they were as bad as many folks were reporting.  Indeed the pair I received were awful.  Vertical misalignment was more that 1/4 of the field of view!!!  Every scene was just double images.  They were so horribly misaligned I didn't even bother attempting to correct them (there are adjustment screws under the rubber skin).

You can certainly ""get lucky"" and get a pair that comes collimated well enough to be usable so be sure to only order from vendors that provide free returns and exchanges.  Unfortunately according to many reports even with careful ""around the house"" handling these binoculars can lose collimation.  Something is just plain wrong with the design of the prism holders.

Lastly be advised that Celestron is clearly aware of this problem as they have specifically limited the warranty on this product to only 30 days for collimation.  So the claimed warranty on this product is in fact worthless - it doesn't cover the one thing that actually ""breaks"" on this pair of binoculars.","Bad quality control, won't hold collimation - trash product.",1514764800.0

The columnation of mine were a little off but 5 minutes and a 5/64"" jewelers flatblade took care of that. Based on how the binoculars prisms are installed (wedged in place with a pair of leaf springs) I can see there might be a periodic need to touch up the columnation so its probably good to learn to do it.

The body of each objective lens carrier is plastic and I found the prism housings are cast from metal. The exterior of the glasses appear to be reasonably well finished and there are rubber grips covering the prism housings to make handling them a little more secure.

I find the binoculars are bright and clear with an image as good as the stability of the tripod or monopod the which you have them mounted.  At this magnification, hand use is difficult to impossible so I recommend a good stable tripod and adapter.  Which brings me to the only thing I don't like about the package.  The binocular mounting adapter supplied is simply too flimsy to work with something this heavy.  The adapter will oscillate about the pan axis when anything is disturbed, and this will go on for quite a long time. The design could have worked with a higher modulus plastic resin, perhaps with a fiber fill, but it wasn't and doesnt.  I have a 3rd party adapter coming to correct this but I have read that if one fills the voids within the outline of the beam of this adapter with something like 2-part epoxy, the stability increases a good deal.  I haven't tried this, but it could work.

Edit 1/6/16: The 3rd party adapter I ordered has been delayed a bit and my new tripod was scheduled for delivery today, so I went ahead and filled the recesses of the adapter with 2 part epoxy today.  This evening the tripod arrived and with the mostly cured epoxy filled adapter I was able to do a little star gazing.  I must say the adapter with the added epoxy is way more stable. No more oscillations.  For what its worth I used West System 2 part epoxy resin and hardener that I have on hand for repairs to our windsurfers. It would probably cost one more to buy a package with the amount I used in it than the cost of a better adapter, but I had it on hand and am not expecting to use it up on board repairs so it cost me nothing.",Nice.

It sounds and works well all by itself without the second subwoofer. The two together is almost too much. I love it though because I love thumping bass. Movies, music, everything sounds good. I've turned the volume all the way up for testing and to revel in all the thundering bass. However, even half volume is plenty and sounds great. I really crank the volume when I'm home alone or don't have annoyed housemates. My home setup now competes with the booming sound system in my SUV.

The first 12"" lasted just over two years. I could not find my receipt so warranty was not available. I decided to try another 12"" which lasted less than a year before it died. Contacting Polk I was instructed to remove the amp and given an address to ship to. No shipping pre paid label was available. The amp came back to me in less than two weeks, I reinstalled it and it plays fine now. I called the Polk repair center to discuss the customer having to pay for shipping a warrantied product. They told me this was the policy. Upon expressing my displeasure and that I was giving them a second chance the tech freed to reimburse me the $26.00 spent shipping cost. It's now several months later and to date no reimbursement. So if you purchase Polk be aware even under warranty the shipping costs will be on you!

I had a JBL Power Bass PB12. It was a 12"", down firing, 250W earthquake machine. After that thing prematurely fried, and Best Buy screwed me on the warranty, I was sub-less for a while. I went back to the old school ""wall of sound"" routine with old amps, EQ's, and stacks of very large speakers. Sounded great, but took up a lot of space. But what do I care - Im a bachelor! Fast forward a few years and now there is a kid crawling around, and an ol' lady who wants the speakers out. Time to do this right. I buy new Denon head unit, a ceiling mounted Harmon/Kardon satellite speaker set-up, and its time to put some bass in the place. I think back, fondly, of my PB12, and the places it literally shook apart. I know it has to be those specs or better, but I don't want to spend a fortune. Along in the reviews of my poor old PB12 (Which was actually a POS prone to blowing the amp) comes this Polk Audio (Trusted name), 12"" (good, good), 350W (NICE, NICE), front firing (booo), budget friendly sub. I read some more reviews and make my mind up.
I put my order in for the Polk Audio PSW505 and it arrives a few days later. It must weigh 40lbs+. Thats always a good sign. I get it hooked up, and I can tell I won't be disappointed. I have the gain at about 1.5 and I can feel the floor shake.

I have the crossover set to the highest setting as I am using small satellite speakers that don't reproduce any real bass. So far movies sound great and the little music I have played (Rock to rap to classical) sound like everything is where it should be. I do have some more tweaking and tuning, and a full break-in cycle to go, but I think this might be the beginning of a beautiful relationship.....
I will update this once it is fully tuned, broken in, and given a good workout.

****UPDATE****
4/25/16
So after some tuning and tweaking I've discovered a few things....
Pros:
This thing SHAKES. I mean wall cracking, stuff falling off tables, cabinets rattling, BOOOOOOOMMMMMMM box. It definitely has enough power to drive the speaker. Speaking of the speaker, the surround on it is YUGE. It pretty much resembles a car audio sub, which is nice. There is more than enough room for some serious cone excursion, and enough power to push it.
Cons:
The ""Volume"" control works like this: Off and on. Seriously, 0-3 will adjust the volume, but its a very fine trim. 3-8 is exactly the same volume (Might as well be 8), and 8-10 is pretty much 10. So basically all of your tuning comes in about 1/4"" of knob turn.
The crossover does not work. At all. Not even slightly. Ive gone through a bunch of tuning with bass tones and the crossover does absolutely nothing. Nada. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Its pretty much factory set at the middle, which is fine, but I would have liked a bit more control.
Given these developments I have revised my rating from 5 stars to 4.
Final judgement?
I really don't think there is another home audio sub on the market at this price range that could possibly even attempt to compete with this sub. Im very happy with it so far, and Im sure you will be too.

Like the other travel charger I purchased prior, this one also comes with a nice drawstring travel pouch for on-the-go travel. It contains three outlets: two on the side and one at the bottom center with two USB ports at the top. Clear and visible LED light to indicate your plug-in outlet is protecting all devices plugged into the device. I personally use this in the house in a spare area that I have a counter where I'd normally rest my mobile device to charge during short in-between stays before running to work or another errand. While only a 2.1 AMP charger, it more than suits my needs and allows me to not obstruct a much needed outlet space since I don't have to plug in the combo charger/USB connector into the device -- I'm able to plug the USB in direct to this unit to charge. This makes it more ideal for on-the-go travel since it gives you three outlets that are nicely spaced regardless of what you plug into the unit and most mobile charging devices currently have a detachable USB cord so this gives me the ability to charge a BlueTooth headset and cell while traveling. At times hotels can experience less than ideal energy flow, with this unit -- you can ensure that you have your device protected while on the go and traveling. It's easy to register the device through the Tripp Lite site and ensure the $5,000 Ultimate Lifetime Insurance (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico only) covers your gear. This is not intended to maintain a mini entertainment center, it's more for on-the-go use but Tripp Lite also offers a variety of good devices for surge protection if you're looking for protection on a larger amount of equipment. While it may look ideal for use with a Raspberry Pi and side equipment, I have not personally tested this specifically, it should have the AMP coverage needed to easily supply a unit for those looking for an all contained travel or stationary unit in the home. If in the future should I see that it can protect and supply power properly to a device I'll make a note to update this review.

I picked wired version over wireless mainly to avoid potential connectivity issue (which some other reviewers have encountered) and changing/recharging batteries.  Of course, being wired means I have to deal with cable but I find that less of an issue.

There are no manuals in the box.  Aside from trackball, the box came with wrist pad (which I use), papers that listed web address to download TrackballWorks Software (Windows or Mac) and web address to download manual.  Another paper had warranty information and wrist pad info.

You ""can"" use the trackball without installing software but it is to your benefit to visit Kensington site to download and install so to enhance user experience.  The software once installed to your computer will allow you to configure trackball to your likings (i.e., trackball speed, pick which functions for each buttons etc.)

Once configured to the way I like it I first played around without the included wrist pad and then attached it.  For myself, I liked the feel with the pad attached.

I used Kensington's cheaper Orbit trackball when I first transitioned from regular mouse to trackball due to my wrist problem.

I've played around with trackballs a few times in the past, but this is the first time I've found one that I really like. Unlike most trackballs, the large top-mounted ball feels natural to use. The ball is heavy and has more momentum than most trackballs, but is light enough that it can be stopped instantly with a light touch. The scroll wheel is also awesome, and feels natural almost immediately. The trackball software is clean and minimal, and allows the mouse buttons to be remapped.

There are a few minor issues. The ball is _NOT_ secured in the base. If you turn it over, the ball will fall out. However, are carrying case options on Amazon that fix that problem during transportation. The button layout is sort of strange, and the default button mapping is difficult to use if you're accustomed to a mouse with 5 buttons. It would be nice to have a fifth button, possibly directly above the trackball. A slightly thicker optional wrist pad would be nice -- depending on the position of your arm, it can put your wrist in an uncomfortable position.

This trackball has become my daily driver, and I feel confident recommending this to anyone who has wrist pain (consider alternating between this and a normal mouse!), or just wants a pointing device that's fun to use, and different from what they're accustomed to.","Easy to acclimate, fun to use",1520640000.0

UPDATE: I tried contacting Kensington customer service to get the bluetooth glitches fixed. The customer support rep. was unable to understand me and due to the strong accent I was unable to understand her either. After taking 5 minutes to communicate the spelling of my email address the customer service rep. spent 35 minutes ""troubleshooting"" the device, and trying to convince me to ignore the bluetooth problems and to just use USB mode.

When I contacted customer support they had me try the following:
-bend the battery contacts inside the battery compartment to try to get a ""better connection"" (this is clearly not the issue since USB mode works fine, which also requires a good battery connection)
-replacing the batteries which have already been replaced (and work just fine for USB mode)
-uninstall the Kensington Software and use the device without it
-reboot randomly
-turn off bluetooth on all devices in my employer's 30+ story office building (Rep: ""Can you turn off bluetooth on all other devices in the building?"")

At the end of the call the customer service rep. told me that since the device worked for a single instant that proved her troubleshooting steps had resolved my intermittent bluetooth failure. As I type the the device is again handing for seconds at a time while other devices attached to my computer both over USB and bluetooth continue to work fine. The customer service rep. then said I could mail the device to Kensington headquarters without providing any information as to how. I'm supposed to be receiving an email from her with further instructions, but I'm not confident that will happen given the communication problems we had in establishing a record of contact information. I asked her to send the email while we were on the phone so that I could ensure I received it; she refused saying I would have to wait ten minutes to receive it.

I also have to wait 11 business days after kensington receives my product before they will send out a replacement. Including shipping time this will result in 3-4 weeks of downtime without the trackball while I wait on a replacement.

One of the best value purchases I have made. Suits the Canon brand well- on the surface not the most innovative, maybe slightly behind the newest thing, but you take it out in the field and it just performs without worry. While the new Canon glass is some of the sharpest available, their cameras and this bag are definitely not the flashiest, but they get the job done without getting in the way and they take massive beating.

PROS:

-Durable: I've had this 5 years and everything still works. No tears or fraying. I did break a zipper on an inner pocket after 4 years, but still use the pocket just fine. The durability is impressive for an affordable bag (I bought for 35 US) that I have treated like crap. I've carried this around almost daily with thousands in gear in it, not been gentle with it at all, I just toss it down wherever on the floor, ground, car seat. It is a tank without the weight or lack of flex that many bag designs seem to add for the same result.
-Simple: It isn't that pretty, it's basic, not the most comfortable, but like a lot of Canon stuff is durable and usable - it gets the job done well over and over again without a lot of fanfare. Adding bells and whistles often compromises the basic goal or ruins ergonomics anyway. While fancy features sound great, they often compromise a product or break. The simplicity of this bag has made it one of my most used.
-Strong for size: I carry a heavy gear load out of 1-2 large DSLR bodies, 3-4 L series lenses, Square ND filter set, 8 batteries, personal items, water, headlamps regularly with no worry that the bag will break.
-Capacity: I can get much more into this than similar sized bags. It has just enough padding, but much less than almost everything else. People think they need so much padding, but that makes packing inflexible, adds weight, etc. For example the slightly larger Basics bag I tried holds much less and is a pain to pack because of the rigid padding on all sides.
-Affordable: back a few years this was a great price. Now I see resellers have jacked that up. Still probably worth it.

Note that after 5 years, the zipper has gotten looser and in a very few cases the teeth were not joining. I fixed the zipper pull with pliers and all is well again. I had one incident where the weight of gear inside caused the zipper to unzip, my fault for not zipping to the corners so weight was not on the pulls.

CONS:

-Comfort: not horrible, but hardly has the support and padding that some bags do. This is both a pro and con. Makes the bag lighter and more comfortable, but heavily loaded it is somewhere in the middle on the comfort scale.
-Style: again simplicity is good, but it is somewhere on the middle of style. Not sexy, functional.
-Tripod straps: system not great, but then this is s very small bag so why expect much? You can strap a small tripod to the side or bottom. I almost always carry a large tripod that would never strap to this size bag.
-side pockets: not a fan of the loose velcro. These are not secure enough to hold things that could fall out, not large enough to hold a water bottle. I stopped using them for the most part.

I wanted to try this wrap because even though I loved the Tenba wraps I heard this Domke wraps were a bit thinner and less bulky when all folded up.

This wraps are definitely thinner, but still over the bump and scratch protection that all these different wraps are designed for.

The Velcro strip on these wraps are also better in two ways:
1. They are rectangular strips that start from the corner, unlike covering a whole corner like the Tenbas. While that may sound less secure they bite just fine and actually make it easier to open a fold of the wraps making it a bit easier to access what is inside.
2. The type of velcro used is a nicer fine toothed type and feels like it is less likely to do any damage itself to the objects inside. Compared to the Tenba that uses more familiar high toothed velcro I prefer the fine shorter teeth on the Domke. Easy test if to run them on your finger; the domkes got some scratch, but the Tenbas will definitely work better to scratch that itch.

Either way these wraps (Domke or Tenba) will not provide much in the drop protection department, they are deinitely equal in the scratch protection department. Both fully cover my GX8 with 12-35 lens attached without issue and look to have a little room to spare. In the bump department, the Tenbas definitely win providing a little more padding and dead space to soak up the impacts from other items in a bag or backpack, but I honestly think most people would sacrifice that for the more compact item after they have been wrapped.

Another definitely plus is the COLORS! While at first that might seem gimmicky, it makes a world of a difference opening a top loading backpack that feels like a black hole and seeing a feint blue object inside. I can only image how much easier it would be to find what I need if I used YELLOW (which I definitely want to pick up soon). While the Tenbas come in multiple colors, they are more earthy and toned down.

Overall I'm happy I made the switch. I may still use the Tenba smaller wraps for more delicate items in my backpack- like lens since they provide just that much more padding, but the Domke Wrap has definitely found it's permanent home protecting my GX8 whenever I am not using a ""Camera"" bag.","Less Bump Protection than Tenba, but BETTER?!",1466294400.0

2,,True,2016-01-08,A14N13TSEZ38A7,B00009R8T5,,GScott,"This works. The only reason I am giving it such a low rating, is that it is ridiculous that an expensive Nikon DSLR camera would need such a thing. When the mirror is retracted (in Live VIew) the camera should automatically block the entry of light from the viewfinder.

This item has a clip on it to keep it attached to your camera strap. It would be very easily lost otherwise. The problem is, the eyepiece you have to remove to install this item, is also easily lost or misplaced. This item should go on OVER the existing eyepiece so that you don't have to remove it. But the optimum solution, would be to eliminate the need for it entirely.

Update 7/24/16...Predictably, I've now lost it. I have no idea when it disappeared. I just noticed it not longer on the neck strap, and haven't used it for about 2 months!  I'll probably buy 2 this time, and put one away for safe keeping. Obviously, clipping it to the neck strap almost insures that you will lose it.  Also, I'm glad I replaced the standard eyecup with a much larger one that shields the light much better. Not only because of the shielding function, but because the standard eyecup is so small, it will almost certainly be lost when removed to put this cap in it's place.","Works, but is rediculous that an expensive DLSR would need such a thing.",1452211200.0
4,,True,2017-09-24,A3W47YMIA6I3KO,B00009R89L,{'Color:': ' Brown'},OMD,"Bought this for my Olympus Pen F camera so that I can take it with one or two lenses as a day outing pack. It works and fits. What I especially like about it is the belt allowance on the backside (you can weave your belt into it so that its super secure) since I live in a rather dangerous area where people can and do snatch things. I feel safer that way.

The 3 compartments also allow me to carry a long Olympus mirrorless lens.

What I don't like about it however is that
1. The shoulder strap is short. I'm 5ft 10inches, so not too tall, but when I strap this around me like a messenger bag (remember that part about people snatching things?) - it's too short. So it only works for me when I weave my belt into and it sits on my front.
2. Hate the Domke label at the front. I figure that if they want me to advertise for them then they should pay me. I cut it out.
3. I watched a few YouTube video's on it. Seemed as though I would be able to fit my Nikon FX D610 with 24-120mm lens, a lens and a few accessories, keys, spare battery (and maybe my car, briefcase and spare wheel). We'll it doesn't fit! All this can carry is a small mirrorless and keys, battery and maybe one lens. If you do insist on carrying your DSLR then you'd have to have a small lens and you'd have to detach the lens off the body and insert the body sideways - too much hustle to keep putting on and taking off your lens (in addition to the danger of introducing dust on the sensor).",Good for Mirrorless Camera Only.,1506211200.0
5,,True,2016-04-19,A2M69Y3THUIXTJ,B00009R89L,{'Color:': ' Brown'},P. G. Woodhouse,"This is a great little bag, particularly for travel. I can carry my camera in the center section, a zoom lens in another, and an assortment of batteries, filters, cloths and chargers in the third.

There's a sleeve between the compartments and the exterior which can for an ipad mini and a guidebook. It's a tight squeeze though. With just the iPad mini, it's perfect. Note, this is not big enough to carry a full size iPad. I took this on vacation recently and carried all the camera equipment listed above (a Sony alpha 6) plus an ipad, kindle, battery pack for the iPad, assorted cables, header and a few documents (printed itinerary). If there was a way to shove my iPhone in there and carry a small tripod, it would be complete perfection.

Ask of the above is inside the zippered section, so it's fairly secure. There's another slim pocket outside the zippered section but under the flap, which might be good for documents (boarding passes?) that you need fast access to, but it won't fit a smartphone in a cover, and it's not particularly secure.

In addition to the above, there's a bonus in that the bag doesn't really look like much. It has a slightly weathered look to it, and a bit of an Indiana Jones vibe.

The strap has non slip rubber or something on one side, and is really comfortable. The zipper is chunky and the whole thing feels well made and like it'll last for decades.",Pretty much perfect,1461024000.0

It consists of 24 pages of 13"" x 19"" sleeves in a heavy polypropylene cover. Each sleeve holds two 13 x 19 photographs separated by a black insert sheet, for total capacity of 48 photos. It's vertically bound (portrait orientation). Per the label, the paper inserts in the sleeves are black acid-free ""European sourced"" paper, whatever that means.

There were three labels: two fixed by adhesive to the front cover and a third inserted into a sleeve along the spine. The adhesive labels peeled off easily without leaving a residue. The paper insert along the spine is also easily removable by opening the book so that it's flat, then carefully reaching into the sleeve and removing the paper insert. (If you wish, you can reverse the insert, write your own description, and replace it.)

It's a marvelous way to safely and securely hold prints so that they can be stored and viewed. Having bought one I plan to buy more in both the 13x19 and smaller sizes.
